**DataStoreService** exposes methods for getting [GlobalDataStore](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GlobalDataStore) and
[OrderedDataStore](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/OrderedDataStore) objects. Data stores can only be accessed by game servers,
so you can only use [DataStoreService](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DataStoreService) within a [Script](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Script) or a [ModuleScript](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ModuleScript)
that is used by a [Script](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Script).

See [Data Stores](/scripting/data/data-stores) for an in-depth guide on data
structure, management, error handling, etc.
