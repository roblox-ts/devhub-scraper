This method returns an [`OrderedDataStore`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/OrderedDataStore), similar to the way
[`GetDataStore()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DataStoreService#GetDataStore) does with
[`GlobalDataStores`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GlobalDataStore). Subsequent calls to this method
with the same name/scope will return the same object.
