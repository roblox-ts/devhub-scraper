When the cursor is outside the trackball, the [`DragDetector`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DragDetector) can
apply a roll rotation that turns the ball as if it were mounted on a vinyl
record facing the viewer. This property is a 0 to 1 multiplier for adding
that roll rotation to the total. Only relevant if
[`DragStyle`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DragDetector#DragStyle) is
`Enum.DragDetectorDragStyle|RotateTrackball`.
