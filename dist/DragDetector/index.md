[`DragDetector`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DragDetector) instances encourage physical interaction with objects in
an experience, such as opening doors and drawers, sliding a part around, and
much more. Key features include:

- Place a [`DragDetector`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DragDetector) under any part or model to make it draggable
via all inputs (mouse, touch, gamepad, and VR), all without a single line of
code.
- Choose from many [`DragStyle`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DragDetector#DragStyle) options, define
how the object responds to motion via
[`ResponseStyle`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DragDetector#ResponseStyle), and optionally apply axis
or movement limits.
- Scripts can respond to manipulation of dragged objects to drive UI or make
logical decisions, such as adjusting the light level in a room based on a
sliding wall switch dimmer.
- Players can manipulate anchored parts or models and they'll stay exactly
where you put them upon release.
- [`DragDetectors`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DragDetector) work in Studio as long as you're **not**
using the **Select**, **Move**, **Scale**, or **Rotate** tools, making it
easier to test and adjust draggable objects while editing.

See the [Drag Detectors](https://create.roblox.com/docs/ui/drag-detectors) article for details
and usage examples.
