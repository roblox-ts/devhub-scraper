In any dimension, if this is less than
[`MaxDragTranslation`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DragDetector#MaxDragTranslation), translation
will be clamped within that range. This is not a constraint; it merely
impedes the drag detector's attempts to generate motion in order to remain
within limits.
