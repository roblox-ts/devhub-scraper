In any dimension, if this is greater than
[`MinDragTranslation`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DragDetector#MinDragTranslation), translation
will be clamped within that range. This is not a constraint; it merely
impedes the drag detector's attempts to generate motion in order to remain
within limits.
