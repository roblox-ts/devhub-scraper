When the cursor is outside the trackball, the [`DragDetector`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DragDetector) can
apply a radial pull rotation that turns the ball as if it were trying to
roll out toward the cursor. This property is a 0 to 1 multiplier for
adding that rotation as a contribution to the total. Only relevant if
[`DragStyle`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DragDetector#DragStyle) is
[`RotateTrackball`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/DragDetectorDragStyle).
