Stores a chunk of terrain into a [`TerrainRegion`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TerrainRegion) object so it can be
loaded back later. Note: [`TerrainRegion`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TerrainRegion) data does not replicate
between server and client.
