A singleton class used to create [`Plugins`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Plugin). This has been
superseded by the [Plugins](https://create.roblox.com/docs/studio/plugins) but it can be used to
create plugins with the command bar.

The PluginManager object can be retrieved using the deprecated
[`PluginManager()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PluginManager) function.
