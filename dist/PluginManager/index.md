A singleton class used to create [Plugins](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Plugin). Has been superseded by the [official plugins feature](https://developer.roblox.com/articles/Intro-to-Plugins), but can be used to create plugins with the command bar.

The PluginManager object can be retrieved using the deprecated `PluginManager()` function.
