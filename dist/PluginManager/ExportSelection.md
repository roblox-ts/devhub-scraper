ExportSelection will export all geometry in the current [`Selection`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Selection)
to an .OBJ file. The file is saved to the path chosen by the user in a
file save dialogue (the `filePath` argument is ignored). This function
does the same thing as the **Export Selection...** right-click menu option
in the Explorer.
