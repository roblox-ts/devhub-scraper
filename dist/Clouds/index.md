The **Clouds** object renders realistic clouds that drift slowly across the
sky. Both cloud cover and density can be adjusted, as well as cloud color to
achieve atmospheres like stormy skies, moody sunsets, alien worlds, etc.

See the [Dynamic
Clouds](/building-and-visuals/lighting-and-effects/index) article for a summary of properties and expected results.
