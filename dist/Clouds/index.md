The **Clouds** object renders realistic clouds that drift slowly across the sky. Both cloud cover and density can be adjusted, as well as cloud color to achieve atmospheres like stormy skies, moody sunsets, alien worlds, etc.

See the [Dynamic Clouds](https://developer.roblox.com/articles/dynamic-clouds) article for a summary of properties and expected results.
