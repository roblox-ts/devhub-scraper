This property controls the material color of cloud particles. However,
cloud color is influenced by several [`Lighting`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Lighting) and
[`Atmosphere`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Atmosphere) properties, so it is not intended as a dedicated
property to simulate colored sunsets, sunrises, etc.

See the [Dynamic Clouds](https://create.roblox.com/docs/environment/clouds)
article for a summary of properties and expected results.
