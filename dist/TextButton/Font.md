The Font property selects one of several pre-defined fonts with which the
UI element will render its text. Some fonts have bold, italic and/or light
variants (as there is no font-weight or font-style properties).

With the exception of the "Legacy" font, each font will render text with
the line height equal to the [TextButton.TextSize](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextButton#TextSize) property. The "Code"
font is the only monospace font. It has the unique property that each
character has the exact same width and height ratio of 1:2. The width of
each character is approximately half the [TextButton.TextSize](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextButton#TextSize) property.
