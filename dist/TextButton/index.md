A TextButton behaves similarly to [`TextLabel`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextLabel) in regards to rendering
with the additional behaviors of a [`GuiButton`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiButton). It defines the same
text-rendering properties as a [`TextLabel`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextLabel) does.

You can disable text rendering by setting [`TextButton.TextTransparency`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextButton#TextTransparency)
to 1. This will leave you with a plain rectangle that can be used as a button.
