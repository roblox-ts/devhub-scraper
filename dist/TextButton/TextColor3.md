This property determines the color of all the text rendered by a
[`GUI`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextButton) element. This property along with
[`TextButton.Font`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextButton#Font), [`TextButton.TextSize`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextButton#TextSize) and
[`TextButton.TextTransparency`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextButton#TextTransparency) will determine the visual properties
of text. Text is rendered after the text stroke
([`TextButton.TextStrokeColor3`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextButton#TextStrokeColor3)).

It's important that text is easily read by players! Be sure to choose
colors with little-to-no saturation, like white, grey, or black. Make sure
the color of your text is contrasted by the
[`TextButton.BackgroundColor3`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextButton#BackgroundColor3) of the UI element. If the element has
a transparent background, try applying a black
[`TextButton.TextStrokeColor3`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextButton#TextStrokeColor3) to help contrast the text with the 3D
world behind it.
