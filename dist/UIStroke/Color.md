Determines the [`UIStroke`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UIStroke) stroke color. You can also insert a
[`UIGradient`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UIGradient) instance as a child of the UIStroke to create gradient
strokes.

Note that both the parent object and UIStroke can have child UIGradients,
letting you set gradients on both the stroke and fill independently.
