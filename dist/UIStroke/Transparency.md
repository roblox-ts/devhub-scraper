The [Transparency](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UIStroke#Transparency) property sets the stroke opacity
independently of the parent object's
[BackgroundTransparency](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiObject#BackgroundTransparency) or
[TextTransparency](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextLabel#TextTransparency). This allows you to render
text and borders that are "hollow" (consisting of only an outline).
