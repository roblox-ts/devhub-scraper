The Team that owns the [FlagStand](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/FlagStand). Corresponds with the TeamColors in the
[Teams](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Teams) service.

The [Flag](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Flag) and [FlagStand](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/FlagStand) objects were created to allow developers to
make 'Capture the Flag' style games quickly. However they have been
deprecated and developers are advised to design their own systems which
will be more flexible and reliable.

To get started with this, developers can use the 'Capture The Flag'
template place provided by Roblox which has a fully functioning system
developers can take and use in their own games. A link to the place, which
is free to edit, is [here][1].
