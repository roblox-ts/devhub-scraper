**RotateIncrement** determines the angle in degrees by which studio's
rotation tool will rotate selected objects each tick. This is set by the
user Model tab under the "Snap to Grid" section.

The table below shows how the rotation handles appear while dragging.
Notice how lower values render more axles. In these images,
[`UseLocalSpace`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/StudioService#UseLocalSpace) is `true`.
