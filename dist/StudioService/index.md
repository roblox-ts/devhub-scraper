StudioService provides access to configuration of Roblox Studio, allows importing files from the user's file system, and other miscellaneous information. It is intended to be used by [Plugin](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Plugin)s in order to provide a consistent user experience.

*   Plugins that allow the user to move objects may find [GridSize](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/StudioService/GridSize), [RotateIncrement](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/StudioService/RotateIncrement) and [UseLocalSpace](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/StudioService/UseLocalSpace) useful.
*   Plugins that require the user to import files should use [PromptImportFile](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/StudioService/PromptImportFile) or [PromptImportFiles](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/StudioService/PromptImportFiles) in order to receive [File](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/File) objects.
*   Plugins that display icons of Instance classes can use [GetClassIcon](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/StudioService/GetClassIcon).
*   Plugins that care about which script is currently being edited (if any) can read this from [ActiveScript](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/StudioService/ActiveScript).
