Transforms the [PVInstance](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/PVInstance) along with all of its descendant [PVInstances](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/PVInstance) such that the pivot is now located at the specified [CFrame](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/datatype/CFrame). This is the primary function that should be used to move [Models](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Model) via scripting.

[BaseParts](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BasePart) are moved in this way by having their [CFrame](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/datatype/CFrame) transformed by the necessary offset. [Models](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Model) are moved in this way by having their [Model.WorldPivot](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Model/WorldPivot) transformed by the necessary offset.

Note that for efficiency purposes, [Instance.Changed](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/Instance/Changed) events are not fired for [Position](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BasePart/Position) and [Orientation](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BasePart/Orientation) of [BaseParts](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BasePart) moved in this way; they are only fired for [CFrame](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/datatype/CFrame).

When calling [PivotTo](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/PVInstance/PivotTo) on [Models](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Model), the offsets of the descendant parts and models are cached, such that subsequent calls to [PivotTo](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/PVInstance/PivotTo) on the same model do not accumulate floating point drift between the parts making up the model.

[Models](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Model) and [BaseParts](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BasePart) are both [PVInstances](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/PVInstance) (“Position Velocity Instances”) and so both have this function.
