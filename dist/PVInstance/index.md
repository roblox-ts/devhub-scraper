A [PVInstance](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PVInstance) ("Position Velocity Instance") is an abstract class that cannot
be created. It is the base for all objects that have a physical location in
the world, specifically [BaseParts](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart) and [Models](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Model).
