A PVInstance is an abstract class that cannot be created. It is the base for all objects that have a physical location in the world, specifically [BasePart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BasePart) and [Model](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Model). The PV in PVInstance stands for _Position-Velocity_. This class has existed since 2005, and while the class itself no longer has any functionality, it is used for adornable objects that can be connected to both BaseParts and Models.
