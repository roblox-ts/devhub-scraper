This function gets the pivot of a [`PVInstance`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PVInstance). This is often used
with [`PVInstance:PivotTo()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PVInstance#PivotTo) to move a model.

[`Models`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Model) and [`BaseParts`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart) are both
[`PVInstances`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PVInstance) ("Position Velocity Instances") and so both
have this function.
