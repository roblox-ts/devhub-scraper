This property determines whether outlines are enabled or disabled in a
place.

Outlines can be disabled on a global basis, using this [`Lighting`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Lighting)
property, or alternatively on a surface-by-surface basis for
[`BasePart`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart)s using `Enum.SurfaceType`.

Although this property can be set by scripts, it recommended this property
is set in Roblox Studio prior to publishing the place.
