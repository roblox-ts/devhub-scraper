This property determines whether outlines are enabled or disabled in a place.

Outlines can be disabled on a global basis, using this [Lighting](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Lighting) property, or alternatively on a surface-by-surface basis for [BasePart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BasePart)s using [SurfaceType](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/enum/SurfaceType).

Although this property can be set by scripts, it recommended this property is set in Roblox Studio prior to publishing the place.
