The **Lighting** service controls global lighting in an experience. It
includes a range of adjustable properties that you can use to change how
lighting appears and interacts with other objects, as summarized in
[Lighting Properties](https://create.roblox.com/docs/environment/lighting).

**Lighting** may also contain an [`Atmosphere`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Atmosphere) object to render realistic
atmospheric effects, including particle density, haze, glare, and color. See
[Atmospheric Effects](https://create.roblox.com/docs/environment/atmosphere) for details.

In addition, **Lighting** (along with [`Workspace.CurrentCamera`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Workspace#CurrentCamera)) may
contain post-processing effects such as [`SunRaysEffect`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SunRaysEffect) and
[`BlurEffect`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BlurEffect). See
[Post-Processing Effects](https://create.roblox.com/docs/environment/post-processing-effects) for
more information.
