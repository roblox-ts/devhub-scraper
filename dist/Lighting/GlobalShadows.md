Toggles voxel-based dynamic lighting in the game

What does GlobalShadows do?
---------------------------

When set to true, shadows are rendered in sheltered areas depending on the position of the sun and moon. The lighting hue applied to these areas is determined by the [Lighting.Ambient](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Lighting/Ambient) property. The lighting hue in all other areas is determined by the [Lighting.OutdoorAmbient](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Lighting/OutdoorAmbient) property.

When disabled, shadows are not drawn and no distinction is made between indoor and outdoor areas. As a result, the [Lighting.Ambient](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Lighting/Ambient) property determines the lighting hue and [Lighting.OutdoorAmbient](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Lighting/OutdoorAmbient) will do nothing.

Shadows are calculated using a voxel system, and each lighting voxel is 4x4x4 studs. This means objects need to be larger than 4x4x4 studs to display a realistic shadow. Shadows are also recalculated when [BasePart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BasePart)s are moving.

Note, this property is unrelated to shadows from characters which are displayed regardless of what GlobalShadows is set to.

Toggling GlobalShadows
----------------------

Developers toggling the GlobalShadows setting will notice that disabling it makes the place considerably darker. This is because when GlobalShadows is disabled [Lighting.Ambient](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Lighting/Ambient) is used to calculate the lighting hue in both indoor and ourdoor spaces. This darkness can be resolved by setting [Lighting.Ambient](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Lighting/Ambient) to a higher value such as [Lighting.OutdoorAmbient](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Lighting/OutdoorAmbient)'s default value of 127, 127, 127.

In most cases developers are recommended to leave GlobalShadows enabled due to the superior visual appearance. See the image below for a comparison.
