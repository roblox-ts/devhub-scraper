**Note**  

Fog properties are hidden when Lighting contains an `[Atmosphere](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/new-studio-beta-attributes/984141)` object.

A \`DataType/Color3\` value giving the hue of \`Lighting\`'s fog.

How does fog work?
------------------

Fog in Roblox is displayed in a plane perpendicular to the [Workspace.CurrentCamera](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Workspace/CurrentCamera)s direction. It fades between the [Lighting.FogStart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Lighting/FogStart) property where it is not visible, to the [Lighting.FogEnd](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Lighting/FogEnd) property where it is fully opaque. The effect of fog is it blends color with the FogColor.

At distances greater than [Lighting.FogEnd](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Lighting/FogEnd), color will be determined entirely by the FogColor. However at distances between [Lighting.FogStart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Lighting/FogStart) and [Lighting.FogEnd](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Lighting/FogEnd) the degree to which the color is blended depends on the position.

Roblox's fog uses linear interpolation between [Lighting.FogStart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Lighting/FogStart) and [Lighting.FogEnd](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Lighting/FogEnd). This means if [Lighting.FogStart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Lighting/FogStart) is 10 and [Lighting.FogEnd](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Lighting/FogEnd) is 20, at a distance of 15 studs the fog will be at 50%. That means the color of a pixel at 15 studs will be 50% its normal color blended with 50% of the fog color.

local Lighting = game:GetService("Lighting")
-- fog will fade between 25 and 200 studs
Lighting.FogStart = 25
Lighting.FogEnd = 200

Note, fog does not obscure the skybox.
