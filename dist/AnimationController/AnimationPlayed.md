This event fires whenever the [`AnimationController`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AnimationController) begins playing
an animation. It returns the [`AnimationTrack`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AnimationTrack) playing.

The [`AnimationTrack`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AnimationTrack) can be used to access the animation's playback
functions and events. It will only fire for animations playing on the
specific [`AnimationController`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AnimationController).

See [`Humanoid.AnimationPlayed`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid#AnimationPlayed) for the [`Humanoid`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid) variant of
this function.
