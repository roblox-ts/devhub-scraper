Returns whether the inventory of given [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player) contains an asset, given the ID. This method can query for hats, models, sounds, etc. This function takes a small amount of time to send a request the Roblox website.

In the case that a query fails, this function will throw an error. Therefore, it is recommended to wrap calls to this function in `pcall`.

*   This method should not be used for **game passes**, since they use a separate ID system. Legacy game passes that still depend on an asset ID should use [GamePassService:PlayerHasPass](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/GamePassService/PlayerHasPass) instead of this method.
*   This method cannot be used to check for **developer products** since they can be purchased multiple times but not owned themselves. Use a [GlobalDataStore](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/GlobalDataStore) to save when a developer has bought a developer product instead.
