The private server ID of the reserved server that the players are being
teleported to. This field is populated only if the teleport is to a
reserved server.

This field is not the same as the private server ID of the server that
initiated the teleport, please see: [`DataModel.PrivateServerId`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DataModel#PrivateServerId)
