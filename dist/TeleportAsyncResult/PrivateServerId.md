teleported to. This field is populated only if the teleport is to a
reserved server.

This field is not the same as the private server ID of the server that
initiated the teleport, please see: [DataModel.PrivateServerId](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DataModel#PrivateServerId)
