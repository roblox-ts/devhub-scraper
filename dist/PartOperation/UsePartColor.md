Sets whether the [`PartOperation`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PartOperation) can be recolored using the
[`BasePart.Color`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#Color) or [`BasePart.BrickColor`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#BrickColor) properties. When
true, the entire union will be colored as per [`Color`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#Color)
or [`BrickColor`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#BrickColor). When false, the parts in the
union will maintain their original colors from before the onion operation
was performed.
