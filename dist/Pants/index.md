The Pants object displays shirts on a character model. Pants are items of clothing that cover the legs and torso of the character based on a predefined texture uploaded to Roblox.

How do Pants work?
------------------

Pants only have one property, [Pants.PantsTemplate](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Pants/PantsTemplate). This is a content ID pointing to the pant's texture on the Roblox website.

A Pants object parented to a model will display the pants on the model provided a [Humanoid](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Humanoid) is present and the limbs required for the pants corresponding with the humanoid's [Humanoid.RigType](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Humanoid/RigType) exist.

Note if multiple Pants objects are present in a model only one will be shown. However both a [Shirt](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Shirt) and Pants object will be shown together with the shirt drawn on top (as pants also cover the torso).

Pants automatically load onto new characters spawning based on the [Player.CharacterAppearance](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Player/CharacterAppearance) property.
