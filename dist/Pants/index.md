![A default rig wearing a very dapper pair of pants (rbxassetid://86896501)](https://prod.docsiteassets.roblox.com/assets/legacy/Pants.jpg)

The **Pants** object displays a Pants texture from the Roblox website on a
[`Humanoid`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid) rig. Pants cover the torso and legs, and will be covered by a
[`Shirt`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Shirt) on the torso. To be visible, a Pants must be a sibling of a
Humanoid and have its [`PantsTemplate`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Pants#PantsTemplate) property set
to an appropriate texture (such as `rbxassetid://86896501`, pictured to the
right). The pants texture may be colorized using the [`Clothing.Color3`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Clothing#Color3)
property.

Pants are automatically loaded on [`Player`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player) characters if their avatar is
wearing one.
