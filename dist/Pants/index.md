![A default rig wearing a very dapper pair of pants (rbxassetid://86896501)](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt4b8457e467710f8d/Pants.jpg) The **Pants** object displays a Pants texture from the Roblox website on a [Humanoid](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Humanoid) rig. Pants cover the torso and legs, and will be covered by a [Shirt](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Shirt) on the torso. To be visible, a Pants must be a sibling of a Humanoid and have its [PantsTemplate](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Pants/PantsTemplate) property set to an appropriate texture (such as `rbxassetid://86896501`, pictured to the right). The pants texture may be colorized using the [Clothing.Color3](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Clothing/Color3) property.

Pants are automatically loaded on [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player) characters if their avatar is wearing one.
