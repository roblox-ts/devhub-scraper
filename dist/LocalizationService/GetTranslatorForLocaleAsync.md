This function takes a language code as an argument and yields until the cloud localization data for that locale has been loaded, and then returns a [Translator](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Translator) object which can be used to perform translations for that locale if any are available.

This function can error and thus should be wrapped in a [pcall](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Built-in-Functions-&-Variables-â€”-Lua).
