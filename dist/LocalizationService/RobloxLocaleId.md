This property shows the locale id used for the localization of core and
internal features such as [CoreGui](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/CoreGui) and [CoreScripts](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/CoreScript).

This will return a string with the two letter code (for example, "en-us")
for the locale.
