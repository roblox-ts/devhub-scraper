The vector describing the desired direction to move in, with a magnitude
between 0 and 1. This is multiplied by
[`BaseMoveSpeed`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ControllerManager#BaseMoveSpeed) to determine a final
target move velocity. The [`RootPart`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ControllerManager#RootPart) will
attempt to move in this direction based on the rules defined by the
[`ActiveController`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ControllerManager#ActiveController).
