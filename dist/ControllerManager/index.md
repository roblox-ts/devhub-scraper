The [`ControllerManager`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ControllerManager) instance manages simulated motion control for
its assigned [`ControllerManager.RootPart`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ControllerManager#RootPart). It can be used to build a
physics-based character controller.
