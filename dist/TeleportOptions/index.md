This class is an optional parameter to the [TeleportService:TeleportAsync](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/TeleportService/TeleportAsync) function that allows developers to provide arguments for the teleport call.

Certain arguments in the class are not compatible with each other and these error cases will be handled by TeleportAsync (more details in the `Error` section on the function page).
