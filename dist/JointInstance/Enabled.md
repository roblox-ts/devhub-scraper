This property sets whether the joint is active or not.

When this property is set to true, if the joints's
[`JointInstance.Part0`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/JointInstance#Part0) and [`JointInstance.Part1`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/JointInstance#Part1) properties are
set, then the joint will ensure that its two parts will be connected and
behave according to joint type (e.g. [`Welds`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Weld), and
[`Snaps`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Snap)).
