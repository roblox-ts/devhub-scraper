WedgeParts are great for building slopes because of their slanted surface. They can even be rotated onto their slant so that they can be used at an angle to make a triangular ramp. Due to their collision, WedgeParts can be good for quickly rotating bricks to a certain angle within Roblox Studio, making them a quick solution to using scripting methods such as CFrame to perform the same function. WedgeParts can be adjusted to any size a regular brick can so that they can be aligned with the rest of your building work. WedgeParts, when used next to each other at different angles, can also make great curved ramps without the need for CFrame too
