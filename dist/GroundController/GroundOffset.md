The target distance above the
[`ControllerManager.HitPosition`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ControllerManager#HitPosition) to keep the
[`ControllerManager.RootPart`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ControllerManager#RootPart) at. If the root part is below this
offset from the ground, a force is applied to raise up to this height. If
it's above, nothing happens.
