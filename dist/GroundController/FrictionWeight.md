Amount the character's friction is weighed against the ground friction,
equal in behavior to the
`Datatype.PhysicalProperties.FrictionWeight|FrictionWeight` data type of
[`BasePart.CustomPhysicalProperties`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#CustomPhysicalProperties). Higher values mean more of a
part's `Datatype.PhysicalProperties.Friction|Friction` will be used.
