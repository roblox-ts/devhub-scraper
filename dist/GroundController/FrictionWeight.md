Amount the character's friction is weighed against the ground friction,
equal in behavior to the
[`FrictionWeight`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/datatypes/PhysicalProperties) data type of
[`BasePart.CustomPhysicalProperties`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#CustomPhysicalProperties). Higher values mean more of a
part's [`Friction`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/datatypes/PhysicalProperties) will be used.
