The maximum torque that can be applied on the
[`ControllerManager.RootPart`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ControllerManager#RootPart) for turning towards the
[`ControllerManager.FacingDirection`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ControllerManager#FacingDirection). This effects how quickly
different target angular velocities are reached and how quick angular
deceleration is if
[`MaintainAngularMomentum`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AirController#MaintainAngularMomentum) is
off.
