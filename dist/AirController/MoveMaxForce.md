The maximum force that can be applied on the
[`ControllerManager.RootPart`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ControllerManager#RootPart) for moving in the
[`ControllerManager.MovingDirection`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ControllerManager#MovingDirection). This affects how quickly
different target linear velocities are reached and how quick the linear
acceleration is if
[`MaintainLinearMomentum`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AirController#MaintainLinearMomentum) is
off.
