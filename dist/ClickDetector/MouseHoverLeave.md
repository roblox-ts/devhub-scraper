This event fires when using either a [Script](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Script) or [LocalScript](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/LocalScript).

If you want an function to run when the player clicks, you can use [ClickDetector.MouseClick](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/ClickDetector/MouseClick) and [ClickDetector.RightMouseClick](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/ClickDetector/RightMouseClick) events.
