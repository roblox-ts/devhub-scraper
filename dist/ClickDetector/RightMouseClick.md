This event fires from either a [`Script`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Script) or [`LocalScript`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/LocalScript) when
a player right clicks their mouse cursor on a [`ClickDetector`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ClickDetector) or
[`DragDetector`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DragDetector). Note that the player's
[`Character`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player#Character) must be within the
[`MaxActivationDistance`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ClickDetector#MaxActivationDistance) of the
detector.
