The MaxActivationDistance property controls the maximum distance, in studs, between a [Character](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Player/Character) and the [ClickDetector](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ClickDetector) for the character to be able to click it. This is used to limit from how far a player can interact with a ClickDetector.

For instance, a character within `10` studs of a ClickDetector with a MaxActivationDistance of `5` would not be able to click the ClickDetector because they are out of range. If, however, the MaxActivationDistance was `15`, the character would be able to click it.
