This property controls the maximum distance, in studs, between a
[`Character`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player#Character) and the [`ClickDetector`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ClickDetector) or
[`DragDetector`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DragDetector) for the player to be able to interact with it. For
instance, a character within 10 studs of a [`ClickDetector`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ClickDetector) or
[`DragDetector`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DragDetector) with a max activation distance of 5 would not be able
to use the detector because they are out of range.
