A RayValue is an object whose purpose is to store a single Ray. Similar to
CFrameValue, a RayValue's stored ray cannot be viewed or edited within the
Properties window within studio. Instead, use the Command bar to get and set
the value of these objects. For example, you can use a line like the one below
to create a new RayValue named "Value" within the [`Workspace`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Workspace). It
creates a ray at (0, 50, 0) and it faces in the positive-X direction.

`Instance.new("RayValue").Value = Ray.new(Vector3.new(0, 50, 0), Vector3.new(10, 0, 0))`

Since there is no trivial way to edit rays within Studio, sometimes it is
better to use a CFrameValue instead (which can be changed through a part or
the camera). You can reconstruct a ray from a CFrame using
`Ray.new(cf.p, cf.lookVector * dist)`, where `cf` is a given CFrame and `dist`
is the length of the Ray you want to construct.

Like all "-Value" objects, this single value is stored in the Value property.
The Changed event for this (and other objects like it) will fire with the new
value being stored in the object, instead of a string representing the
property being changed.
