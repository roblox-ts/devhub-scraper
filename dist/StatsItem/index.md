A StatsItem is an internal measurement item that is created by the engine to benchmark many of the backend components of Roblox.  
It cannot be created using `Instance.new`, but its value can be read by plugins. They can be found stored inside of the [Stats](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Stats) service.
