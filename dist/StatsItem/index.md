A StatsItem is an internal measurement item that is created by the engine to
benchmark many of the backend components of Roblox. It cannot be created using
[`Instance`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/datatypes/Instance), but its value can be read by plugins. They can be
found stored inside of the [`Stats`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Stats) service.
