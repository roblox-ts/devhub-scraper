The **Enabled** property of a [WeldConstraint](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/WeldConstraint) sets whether the constraint
is active or not. When this property is set to true, if the constraint's
[WeldConstraint.Part0](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/WeldConstraint#Part0) and [WeldConstraint.Part1](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/WeldConstraint#Part1) properties are set, then
the constraint will ensure that its two connected parts will be locked
together.
