Field of view, often shortened to FOV, is the extent of the observable
game world that can be seen on screen at a given moment. The FieldOfView
property is clamped between 1 and 120 degrees and defaults at 70. Very low
or very high fields of view are not recommended as they can be
disorientating to players.

The FieldOfView property sets how many degrees in the vertical direction
(y-axis) the camera can view. Uniform scaling is enforced meaning the
vertical and horizontal field of view are always related by the [aspect
ratio][1] of the screen. This means the FieldOfView property also
determines the horizontal field of view.

See the images below for an example of how different FieldOfView settings
can impact the extent of the perceptive game world. At a FOV of 70, a
considerable portion of the game world is visible:

However when the FOV is reduced to 30, although the [Camera](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Camera)'s
[Camera.CFrame](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Camera#CFrame) has not changed, a much smaller portion of the game world
is rendered:

#### Suggested uses for FieldOfView

Changing FOV can produce a variety of effects, such as:

- Reducing FOV to give the impression of magnification (for example when
  using binoculars)
- Increasing FOV when the player is 'sprinting' to give the impression of
  a lack of control
