The MaxAxisFieldOfView property sets how many degrees along the longest
viewport axis the camera can view.

When the longest axis is the vertical axis, this property will behave
similar to the [`FieldOfView`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Camera#FieldOfView) property. This is
generally the case when a device is in a portrait orientation. In a
landscape orientation the longest axis will be the horizontal axis. In
this case, the property describes the horizontal FOV of the
[`Camera`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Camera).

See [`FieldOfView`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Camera#FieldOfView) for a more general explanation
of FOV.
