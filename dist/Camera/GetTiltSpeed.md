This function returns the current 'tilt' speed of the [`Camera`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Camera).

The 'tilt' speed of the [`Camera`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Camera) describes the speed at which the
[`Camera`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Camera) is rotating around its [`Camera.Focus`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Camera#Focus) around the
[`Camera`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Camera)'s X axis.
