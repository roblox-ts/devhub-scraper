This function sets the [`Enum.CameraPanMode`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/CameraPanMode) to be used by the
[`Camera`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Camera) on mobile devices.

When the *'EdgeBump' [`Enum.CameraPanMode`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/CameraPanMode) is used, swipe to pan is
disabled and the edge bump camera controls are enabled.

SetCameraPan mode has no effect on PC / Mac users.
