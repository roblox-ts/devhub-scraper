A [`SensorBase`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SensorBase) that outputs data about another [`BasePart`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart) based on
[`Humanoid`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid) floor and ladder detection logic. It is primarily used for
sending data to a character controller. Using a [`ControllerPartSensor`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ControllerPartSensor)
allows you to detect [`BaseParts`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart) in the same manner as the
[`Humanoid`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid) uses for detecting floors and ladders.
