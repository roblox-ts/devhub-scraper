[`AudioAnalyzer`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AudioAnalyzer) takes measurements from audio streams that are wired to
it through [`Wire`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Wire). It provides a single **Input** pin but does not
produce any output streams.
