**ReplicatedStorage** is a general container service for objects that are available to both the server and connected game clients. It is ideal for [ModuleScript](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ModuleScript), [RemoteFunction](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/RemoteFunction), [RemoteEvent](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/RemoteEvent) and other objects which are useful to both server-side [Script](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Script)s and client-side [LocalScript](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/LocalScript)s. [Script](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Script) and [LocalScript](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/LocalScript) objects will not run if they are parented to this service even if they are not [Disabled](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BaseScript/Disabled).

If a [ModuleScript](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ModuleScript) within this service is required by any other script, it will run as normal. Such modules will typically house code that is shared by the server and client. Server-side [Script](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Script) that should run on their own should be parented to [ServerScriptService](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ServerScriptService) instead. Client-side [LocalScript](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/LocalScript) have various other locations where they will eventually be run on a [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player) client: [StarterPlayerScripts](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/StarterPlayerScripts), [StarterCharacterScripts](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/StarterCharacterScripts) or [StarterGui](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/StarterGui).

This service behaves similarly to [ServerStorage](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ServerStorage) except that its contents are replicated. If you are storing assets which should not be visible on the client or have no use to the client at all, you should use that service instead.

Objects parented to this service are fully replicated to clients, and normal replication rules apply: any changes that are made on the client persist but won't be replicated to the server. Client changes may be overwritten if the server does something that overwrites those changes. For instance, a [Part](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Part) parented to ReplicatedStorage by the server may have a blue [BrickColor](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BasePart/BrickColor). A client could change this property to red locally, but this change remains only client. Should the server change the color to green, this change would be replicated to the client.
