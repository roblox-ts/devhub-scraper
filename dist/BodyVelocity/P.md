his property is ignored if PGS is enabled via
Workspace.PGSPhysicsSolverEnabled, which is enabled by default.

The P property determines how much
[power](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)>) is used while
applying force in order to reach the goal
[Velocity](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BodyVelocity#Velocity). The higher this value, the more power
will be used and the faster it will be used. The force the [BodyVelocity](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BodyVelocity)
exerts increases as the difference between the part's current velocity and
the goal velocity increases. This property is multiplied to this force to
either amplify or diminish it.
