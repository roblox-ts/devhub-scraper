The **LinearVelocity** constraint applies force on a part/assembly to maintain
a linear velocity.

This object maintains all functionality of [BodyVelocity](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BodyVelocity), a legacy body
mover. To instead apply a constant force, use a [VectorForce](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/VectorForce) object instead.
