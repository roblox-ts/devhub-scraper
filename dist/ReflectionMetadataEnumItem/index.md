The ReflectionMetadataEnumItem is the class containing information about a
specific EnumItem embedded within an Enum and should be parented to a
[`ReflectionMetadataEnum`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ReflectionMetadataEnum).

Since it is an internal object, it cannot be used by developers.
