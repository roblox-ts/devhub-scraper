A [`SensorBase`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SensorBase) is an instance that, when parented to a [`BasePart`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart),
outputs additional data about the world around that part. This data is
presented in the sensor's "output" property category. Often, other systems
will consume the sensor's output data.
