Determines whether the animation stored in this AnimationClip is intended
to loop. When set to true the animation will continuously repeat each time
the animation finishes. [AnimationTrack](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AnimationTrack) instances internally load an
AnimationClip when an [Animation](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Animation) is requested (by AnimationID), and the
[AnimationTrack](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AnimationTrack) `Looped` property will default to the original
[AnimationClip](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AnimationClip) value. Note this value can be overwritten.
