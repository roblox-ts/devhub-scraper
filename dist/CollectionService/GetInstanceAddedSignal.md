GetInstanceAdded is given a tag (a string) and returns a signal which fires under two conditions:

*   The tag is assigned to an object within the [DataModel](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/DataModel) (game) using [CollectionService:AddTag](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/CollectionService/AddTag)
*   An object with the given tag is added as a descendant of the [DataModel](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/DataModel), e.g. by setting [Instance.Parent](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Instance/Parent) or similar

Subsequent calls to this method with the same tag return the same signal object. Consider also calling [CollectionService:GetTagged](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/CollectionService/GetTagged) to get a list of objects that already have a tag (and thus won't fire the event if they already are in the [DataModel](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/DataModel)).

See also [CollectionService:GetInstanceRemovedSignal](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/CollectionService/GetInstanceRemovedSignal), which returns an event that fires under similar conditions.
