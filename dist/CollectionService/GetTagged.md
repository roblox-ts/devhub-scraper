GetTagged returns a table of objects with a given tag which are descendants of the [DataModel](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/DataModel) (`game`). Such tags have been added using [CollectionService:AddTag](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/CollectionService/AddTag), and removing a tag using [CollectionService:RemoveTag](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/CollectionService/RemoveTag) will ensure this method does not return them. Although the name of this method is past-tense, this method only returns objects **presently** tagged with the given tag. It will not return objects that once had a tag but no longer have it.

If you want to detect all objects with a tag, both present and future, use this method to iterate over objects while also making a connection to a signal returned by `CollectionService/GetinstanceAddedSignal`.

This method does not guarantee any ordering of the returned objects. Additionally, it is possible that objects can have the given tag assigned to them, but not be a descendant of the [DataModel](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/DataModel), i.e. its parent is nil. This method will not return such objects.
