This property describes the ID of the experience that the place running on
the server belongs to.

This ID can be found in the top right corner of the
[Asset Manager](https://create.roblox.com/docs/projects/assets/manager) in Roblox Studio.
When using Roblox Studio, if the place has not been published to Roblox
then the GameId will correspond with the template being used.
