This property describes the [`Enum.CreatorType`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/CreatorType) of the place, whether the
place is owned by a user or a group.

If the [`Enum.CreatorType`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/CreatorType) is *'User'*, then the
[`DataModel.CreatorId`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DataModel#CreatorId) property will describe the
[`UserId`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player#UserId) of the account that owns the game. If the
CreatorType is *'Group'*, then it will describe the group ID.
