This property is broken and should not be used.

This property historically described the `Enum.Genre` of the place as set
on the Roblox website.

This property, along with [`DataModel.GearGenreSetting`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DataModel#GearGenreSetting), no longer
functions correctly due to genres existing on the Roblox website that are
not reflected in the `Enum.Genre` enum. As a result, attempting to read
this property may throw an error.
