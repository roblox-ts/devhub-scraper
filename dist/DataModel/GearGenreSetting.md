This property is broken and should not be used.

This property historically described the [`Enum.GearGenreSetting`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/GearGenreSetting) of the
place, reflecting the gear permissions configured in the place settings.
These settings determine what gear could be added to a
[`Player's`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player) [`StarterGear`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/StarterGear).

This property, along with [`DataModel.Genre`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DataModel#Genre), no longer functions
correctly and attempting to read it may throw an error.
