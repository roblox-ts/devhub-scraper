This property is broken and should not be used.

This property historically described the [GearGenreSetting](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/enum/GearGenreSetting) of the `Articles/Place|place`, reflecting the gear permissions configured in the place settings. These settings determine what gear could be added to a `Player|Player's` [StarterGear](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/StarterGear).

This property, along with [DataModel.Genre](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/DataModel/Genre), no longer functions correctly and attempting to read it may throw an error.
