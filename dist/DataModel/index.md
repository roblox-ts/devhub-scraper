The DataModel (commonly known as **game** after the global variable used to
access it) is the root of Roblox's parent-child hierarchy. Its direct children
are services (such as the [`Workspace`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Workspace) and [`Lighting`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Lighting)) that act as
the fundamental components of a Roblox game.
