The DataModel (commonly known as **game** after the global variable used to access it) is the root of Roblox's parent-child hierarchy. Its direct children are services (such as the [Workspace](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Workspace) and [Lighting](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Lighting)) that act as the fundamental components of a Roblox game.
