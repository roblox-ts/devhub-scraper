Fog properties are hidden when Lighting contains an Atmosphere object.

The **Atmosphere** object pushes Roblox closer toward realistic environments
where sunlight scatters in different ways depending on density and other air
particle properties. It simulates real-world "aerial perspective" and lets you
control light transmission from the background sky through distant objects.
Furthermore, it controls haze and glare conditions, letting you tune a perfect
sunset, foggy afternoon, and more.
