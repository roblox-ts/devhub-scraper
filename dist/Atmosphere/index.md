**Note**  

Fog properties are hidden when Lighting contains an `[Atmosphere](Atmosphere)` object.

The \*\*Atmosphere\*\* object pushes Roblox closer toward realistic environments where sunlight scatters in different ways depending on density and other air particle properties. It simulates real-world "aerial perspective" and lets you control light transmission from the background sky through distant objects. Furthermore, it controls haze and glare conditions, letting you tune a perfect sunset, foggy afternoon, and more.

See the [Atmosphere Controls](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/atmosphere) article for property comparisons and example environments.
