An [Actor](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Actor) is a container for code that can be safely split into its own
thread using `task.desynchronize()`. It should also contain the instances used
by its scripts.

To learn more about using Actors, see
[Parallel Scripting](/scripting/scripts/parallel-scripting).
