The Lifetime property determines how long each segment in its [Trail](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Trail) will last in seconds. Once a segment is drawn, it will wait for the given lifetime (measured in seconds) and then will disappear. The lifetime property defaults to 2 seconds, but can be set anywhere between 0.01 and 20.

The lifetime of a trail is also used by that effect's [Trail.Color](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Trail/Color) and [Trail.Transparency](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Trail/Transparency) properties to determine how each segment is drawn. Both of these properties are sequences, meaning that they define their values at certain keypoints in the segement's lifetime and then interpolate between the values as the segment ages.

If a trail's lifetime changes while there are still segments that the trail has drawn, these segments will immediately behave as if they always had the new lifetime. This means that if they have existed for longer than the lifetime they will be removed immediately.
