The Enabled property determines whether a Trail will be drawn or not. This Enabled property defaults to true.

When enabled is true, the trail will create segments between the current position of its [Trail.Attachment0](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Trail/Attachment0) and the position of the attachments in the last frame.

If enabled is set to false while a trail is drawing no new segments will be drawn, but any existing segments will be cleaned up naturally when they reach the end of their [Trail.Lifetime](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Trail/Lifetime). If you would like to clean up any existing segments, you can use the [Trail:Clear](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Trail/Clear) function at the same time.
