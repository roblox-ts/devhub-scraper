Scales the light emitted from [Trail](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Trail). By default, this property is 1 and
can set to any number within the range [0, 10000].

Increasing the value of [LightInfluence](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Trail#LightInfluence) decreases
the effect of **Brightness**. **Brightness** doesn't have any effect when
[LightInfluence](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Trail#LightInfluence) is 1.
