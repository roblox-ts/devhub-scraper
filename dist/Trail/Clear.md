The Clear function clears the segments of the [Trail](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Trail). This means that any trail that has been drawn will be erased when this function is called, even if that segment's [Trail.Lifetime](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Trail/Lifetime) duration has not yet been reached.

While this is less noticeable for trails with shorter lifetimes, this is useful when cleaning up trails that have a longer lifetime, or for cases where the trail is removed when a certain game action occurs.

Note
----

Calling this function will only affect old segments that have already been done. It will not affect the drawing of any new trail segments after this function call. If you would like to clear existing trail segments, and temporarily prevent new segments from being drawn, consider toggling the trail's [Trail.Enabled](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Trail/Enabled) property to false at the same time.
