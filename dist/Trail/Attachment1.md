A [Trail](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Trail) starts drawing its segments at the positions of its **Attachment0** and [Trail.Attachment1](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Trail/Attachment1).

When the Trail is [Trail.Enabled](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Trail/Enabled) it will record the positions of its attachments every frame. It will connect these positions to the positions of the attachments on the previous frame. This creates a polygon that is then filled in by the Trail's [Trail.Color](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Trail/Color) and [Trail.Texture](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Trail/Texture) (if that Texture exists).

When created a Trail will not have any Attachments set by default. These will need to be set in order for the effect to work.

Changing the Attachments of a Trail while a trail is drawing will remove all of the segments the trail has already drawn.
