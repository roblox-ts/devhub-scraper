This property determines how [Trail.Texture](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Trail/Texture)s are drawn by [Trail](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Trail). The behavior of TextureLength is determined by the [Trail.TextureMode](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Trail/TextureMode) of its trail.

If the TextureLength is changed after its trail has drawn some of its segments, the new length will only be applied to new segments being drawn â€“ old segments will be unaffected.

This value can be any number greater than 0 and defaults to 1.
