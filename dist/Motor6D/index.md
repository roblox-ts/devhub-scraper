**Motor6D** joins two [BasePart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BasePart) ([Part0](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/JointInstance/Part0) and [Part1](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/JointInstance/Part1)) together in an animatable way. The [Transform](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Motor6D/Transform) property determines the offset between these parts. This can be set manually using [RunService.Stepped](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/RunService/Stepped) or through an [Animator](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Animator).

Models whose parts are joined by Motor6D are usually referred to as rigs, typically for [Humanoid](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Humanoid)s. There are two primary kinds of rigs for [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player) avatars: R6 and R15.
