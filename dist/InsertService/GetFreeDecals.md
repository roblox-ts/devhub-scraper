The GetFreeDecals function retrieves a list of Free [Decal](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Decal)s from the Catalog. The return type for this method is very odd, as it returns a single table wrapped in a table.

The best way to explain it is to show a visual of the array returned:

```lua
[1] = {
    CurrentStartIndex = 1, -- This can vary depending on the page you input.
    TotalCount = 21, -- Always 21.
    Results = {
        -- All parameters here are psuedo. They can vary depending on the asset.
        [1] = {    
            Name = "Asset Name",
            AssetId = 0000000,
            AssetVersionId = 0000000,
            CreatorName = "Roblox",
        },
        -- [2], [3], and so on... up to [21]
    },
}
``` 

Yikes! That quite confusing. Unfortunately this method was added in the earlier days of Roblox, where easy to understand return-types weren't a priority.

Thankfully, an example for iterating over this list has been provided at the bottom of this page.

Additionally, if you want to insert [Models](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Model) instead, you can use the [InsertService:GetFreeModels](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/InsertService/GetFreeModels) function.

_Note:_ The page argument starts at 0. So Page 1 = 0, Page 2 = 1, etc.
