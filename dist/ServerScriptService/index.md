**ServerScriptService** is a container service for [Script](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Script), [ModuleScript](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ModuleScript) and other scripting-related assets that are only meant for server use. The contents are never replicated to player clients at all, which allows for a secure storage of important game logic. Script objects will run if they are within this service and not [Disabled](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BaseScript/Disabled).

This service houses just one property, [LoadStringEnabled](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/ServerScriptService/LoadStringEnabled), which determines whether the `loadstring` function in Lua is enabled. It's recommended to keep this disabled for security reasons, as misusing this function can lead to remote code execution vulnerabilities.

Scripts running in ServerScriptService may need access to various other assets which are not scripting-related, such as prefabricated models to be [cloned](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Instance/Clone). Such assets should go in [ServerStorage](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ServerStorage), which behaves similarly to this service except that [Script](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Script) objects will not run even if they are not [Disabled](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BaseScript/Disabled). Assets and [ModuleScript](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ModuleScript) that are useful to both the server and clients should go in [ReplicatedStorage](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ReplicatedStorage) instead. Finally, you can further organize objects within this service through the use of [Folder](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Folder)s without affecting the way it behaves.
