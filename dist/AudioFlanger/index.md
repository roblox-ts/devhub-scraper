[`AudioFlanger`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AudioFlanger) imparts a whooshing or sweeping sound on audio streams by
overlaying a delayed copy of the input stream and modulating the pitch of the
copy. It provides one **Input** pin and one **Output** pin which can be
connected to/from by [`Wires`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Wire).
