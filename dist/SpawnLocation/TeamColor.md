The TeamColor property sets what team the [`SpawnLocation`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SpawnLocation) is
affiliated to. If [`SpawnLocation.Neutral`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SpawnLocation#Neutral) property is false, only
[`Player`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player)s with the same [`Player.TeamColor`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player#TeamColor) as the spawn's
TeamColor will be able to spawn there.

If [`SpawnLocation.AllowTeamChangeOnTouch`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SpawnLocation#AllowTeamChangeOnTouch) is true
[`Player.Neutral`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player#Neutral) will be set to this property upon contact with the
spawn.
