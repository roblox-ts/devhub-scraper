The TeamColor property sets what team the [SpawnLocation](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/SpawnLocation) is affiliated to. If [SpawnLocation.Neutral](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/SpawnLocation/Neutral) property is false, only [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player)s with the same [Player.TeamColor](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Player/TeamColor) as the spawn's TeamColor will be able to spawn there.

If [SpawnLocation.AllowTeamChangeOnTouch](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/SpawnLocation/AllowTeamChangeOnTouch) is true [Player.Neutral](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Player/Neutral) will be set to this property upon contact with the spawn.
