The length of time, in seconds, that a [ForceField](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ForceField) will be applied to a [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player) character spawning at this [SpawnLocation](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/SpawnLocation). If Duration is zero, the [ForceField](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ForceField) is never created, and it will not trigger the [Instance.DescendantAdded](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/Instance/DescendantAdded) or [Instance.ChildAdded](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/Instance/ChildAdded) events.

This default value of this property is 10 seconds.

The duration feature allows developers to easily give [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player)s protection from 'spawn killing' which can be a frustrating experience for players. Note, [ForceField](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ForceField)s will only protect users from [Explosion](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Explosion)s and Weapons that use [Humanoid:TakeDamage](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Humanoid/TakeDamage) to deal damage or otherwise check for a [ForceField](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ForceField).
