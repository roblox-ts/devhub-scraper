The MaxForce property determines the limit on the amount of force that may
be applied on each axis in reaching the goal
[`Position`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BodyPosition#Position). If a part isn't moving, consider
increasing this value (also check that it is not
[`Anchored`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#Anchored) or attached to any anchored parts).
