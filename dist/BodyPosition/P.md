The P property determines how much
[power](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)>) is used while
applying force in order to reach the goal
[Position](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BodyPosition#Position). The higher this value, the more power
will be used and the faster it will be used. The force the [BodyPosition](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BodyPosition)
exerts increases as the difference between the part's current position and
the goal position increases. This property is multiplied to this force to
either amplify or diminish it.
