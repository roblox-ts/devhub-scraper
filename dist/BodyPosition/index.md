This body mover has been superseded by [AlignPosition](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/AlignPosition). It's highly recommended that you use [AlignPosition](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/AlignPosition) for future work.

The **BodyPosition** object applies a force on a [BasePart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BasePart) such that it will maintain a constant position in the world. The [Position](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BodyPosition/Position) property, not to be confused with [BasePart.Position](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BasePart/Position), controls the target world position. This is the translational counterpart to a [BodyGyro](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BodyGyro). If you need further control on a force applied to an object, consider using a [BodyForce](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BodyForce) or [BodyThrust](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BodyThrust) instead.

The strength of the force applied by this object is controlled by several factors, namely the distance to the goal position: the force is stronger when farther away from the goal. This is amplified by [P](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BodyPosition/P) (power). The present velocity will also dampen the force applied by this object, and this is amplified by [D](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BodyPosition/D) (dampening). The resulting force is then capped by [MaxForce](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BodyPosition/MaxForce). Note the force applied on the part to achieve the goal position may vary on a per-axis basis.

Troubleshooting
---------------

*   If the assembly isn't moving, it's likely the [MaxForce](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BodyPosition/MaxForce) is too low. Also check for any [Anchored](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BasePart/Anchored) parts within the assembly or in the way of the assembly.
*   If the assembly is moving horizontally but not vertically, it's likely the [MaxForce](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BodyPosition/MaxForce) is strong enough to overcome friction but not gravity. Consider raising the **Y** component of [MaxForce](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BodyPosition/MaxForce) in order to get the object off the ground.
*   If the assembly is **overshooting** the goal position and springing back, it's likely the [D](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BodyPosition/D) (dampening) is too low. Alternatively, the [MaxForce](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BodyPosition/MaxForce) and/or [P](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BodyPosition/P) may be too high.
*   Any assembly containing a part that contains a **BodyPosition** or a [BodyGyro](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BodyGyro) will not be simulated when interacting with a player unless that player is the `/articles/Network Ownership|network owner` of the assembly.
