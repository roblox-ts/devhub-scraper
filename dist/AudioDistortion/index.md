[`AudioDistortion`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AudioDistortion) distorts audio streams, making them sound fuzzier,
grittier, and louder. It provides one **Input** pin and one **Output** pin
which can be connected to/from by [`Wires`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Wire).
