FireActionButtonFoundSignal will yield the current thread until a call to [ContextActionService:GetButton](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/ContextActionService/GetButton) has been made with the same given action name, at which point that call to GetButton returns the given [ImageButton](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ImageButton). Finally, this function then resumes the current thread.
