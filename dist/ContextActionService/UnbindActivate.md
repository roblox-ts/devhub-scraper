UnbindActivate unbinds an [`Enum.KeyCode`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/KeyCode) used with an [`Enum.UserInputType`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/UserInputType)
for activating a [`Tool`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Tool) (or a [`HopperBin`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HopperBin)) using
[`BindActivate`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ContextActionService#BindActivate). This function
essentially undoes the action performed by that function.
