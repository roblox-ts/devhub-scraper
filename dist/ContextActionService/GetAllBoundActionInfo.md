GetAllBoundActioninfo returns a table which maps all actions' names (those originally passed to [BindAction](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/ContextActionService/BindAction)) to a table returned by [GetBoundActionInfo](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/ContextActionService/GetBoundActionInfo) when called with the action name itself. Using this function, you can inspect all presently bound actions. This is useful when debugging their priority levels or stack orders.
