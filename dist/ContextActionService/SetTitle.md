SetTitle will set the text shown on a touch button created by [BindAction](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/ContextActionService/BindAction). Specifically, this sets the [TextLabel.Text](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/TextLabel/Text) property of a [TextLabel](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/TextLabel) within the [ImageButton](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ImageButton) that would be returned by [GetButton](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/ContextActionService/GetButton). If no such bound action exists (e.g. nothing is returned by GetButton), this function does nothing and throws no error.

This function is part of a family of methods that customize the touch button of an action. Others in this family include [SetImage](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/ContextActionService/SetImage) and [SetPosition](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/ContextActionService/SetPosition).
