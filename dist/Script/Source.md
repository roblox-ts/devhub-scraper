A script's Source is the code to be executed. Modifying the code within a
script modifies the source code executes when the script runs.

For instance, given a script containing the line:

```lua
print("Hello world!")
```

The script's source is the "print("Hello world")" command because it is
what will be executed when the script runs, leading to "Hello world" being
printed in the command line.
