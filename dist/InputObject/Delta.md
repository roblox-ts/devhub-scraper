A `Datatype.Vector3` describing the Delta (change) between mouse/joystick
movements.

This is useful when used with the input's
[`position`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/InputObject#Position) to track the position and movement
of the user's mouse/joystick, such as when you're creating custom movement
or camera scripts. Consider tracking input object changes using the
[`Instance.Changed`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance#Changed) event or when user input changes via events such
as [`UserInputService.InputChanged`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UserInputService#InputChanged) and
[`GuiObject.InputChanged`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiObject#InputChanged).
