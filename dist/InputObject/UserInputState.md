Description

### Begin

0

When an `[InputObject](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/InputObject)` starts to interact with the game. For example, a mouse button down, or a key down, or when a touch begins touching the screen.

### Change

1

When an `[InputObject](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/InputObject)`has already begun interacting with the game, and part of it's state is changing. For example, a mouse position move, or a thumbstick moving, or when a touch begins to move across the screen.

### End

2

When an `[InputObject](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/InputObject)` finishes interacting with the game. For example, a mouse button up, or a key up, or when a touch stops touching the screen.

### Cancel

3

A special circumstance state that indicates this input is now being used for some other function. For example, binding two actions to the same input will cause a function to fire with Cancel.

### None

4

A state that should never be seen in a game, essentially just marks the end of the enum.
