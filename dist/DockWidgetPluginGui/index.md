**DockWidgetPluginGui** is a [`PluginGui`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PluginGui) that displays its contents
inside a dockable Roblox Studio window. It is used to create widgets similar
to the built-in **Animation Editor** and **Terrain Tools**.

This GUI can be created using [`Plugin:CreateDockWidgetPluginGui()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Plugin#CreateDockWidgetPluginGui).
