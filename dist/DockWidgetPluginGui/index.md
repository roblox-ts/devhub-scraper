**DockWidgetPluginGui** is a [PluginGui](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/PluginGui) that displays its contents inside a dockable Roblox Studio window. It is used to create widgets similar to the built-in **Animation Editor** and **Terrain Tools**.

This GUI can be created using [Plugin:CreateDockWidgetPluginGui()](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Plugin/CreateDockWidgetPluginGui).

See the [Building Studio Widgets](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/building-studio-widgets) tutorial for details on working with custom Studio widgets.
