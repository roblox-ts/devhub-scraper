Sets whether or not the highlight is enabled. This does not impact
performance, however if disabled the [`Highlight`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Highlight) instance will still

[`Highlight`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Highlight) instance, it's recommended to delete it rather than
disable it.
