AspectType determines what limits the maximum size of the element.

- When set to FitWithinMaxSize, the constraint will make the object the
  maximum size it can be within its own [GuiBase2d.AbsoluteSize](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiBase2d#AbsoluteSize).
- When set to ScaleWithParentSize, the UI element's maximum size will be
  the size of the parent while still maintaining the aspect ratio..
