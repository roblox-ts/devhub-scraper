AspectRatio determines the width-to-height ratio to maintain. To flip the
ratio to height-to-width, take the inverse (divide 1 by the number or
raise to the -1st power). This value must be greater than zero. Below, a
white [`Frame`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Frame) is placed within the a black [`Frame`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Frame) with two
different width-to-height ratios.
