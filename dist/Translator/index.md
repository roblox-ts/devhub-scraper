The role of a Translator is to manufacture/return strings localized for the viewing player. it can use used to retrieve display-ready localized text from a [LocalizationTable](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/LocalizationTable). The source of the [Translator.LocaleId](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Translator/LocaleId) property, the set of tables it will search, and order it will search them in depends on which method was used to create the Translator instance.

The “key material” for a Translator is the original development language string, and a set of context, where all or part of the context can be used to find a more precise/situational translation for the source string.

It also allows manufacture of translated strings with inserts (data replacements) which may change order based on the target language.
