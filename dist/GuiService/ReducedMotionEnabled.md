Returns true if the user has enabled reduced motion. Defaults to false.

This returns the value of a setting which can be set from the user's side
in either the app settings, under Accessibility, or in the in-game
settings menu (which is called “Reduce Motion”). If the value is true,
this indicates that the user wants motion effects and animations to be
reduced or completely removed.
