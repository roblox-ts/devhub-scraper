The GuiService is a service which currently allows developers to control what
[GuiObject](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiObject) is currently being selected by the gamepad navigator. It also
allows clients to check if Roblox's main menu is currently open.

This service has a lot of hidden members, which are mainly used internally by
Roblox's [CoreScripts](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/CoreScript).
