If activating the `Select` button on a Gamepad or Backslash
will automatically set a GUI as the selected object. Turning this off will
mean that Gui navigation will still work if
[`GuiService.GuiNavigationEnabled`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiService#GuiNavigationEnabled) is enabled but you will have to
set [`GuiService.SelectedObject`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiService#SelectedObject) manually to start Gui navigation.
