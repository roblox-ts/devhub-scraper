Returns two [`Vector2`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/datatypes/Vector2) values representing the inset of user GUIs
in pixels, from the top left corner of the screen and the bottom right
corner of the screen respectively.

The inset values supplied by this function only take effect on
[`ScreenGuis`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ScreenGui) that have their
[`IgnoreGuiInset`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ScreenGui#IgnoreGuiInset) property set to false.
