This method allows developers to disable the built-in notification when a players gameplay is paused. They can then add in their own UI if they wish to customize it.

Developers can query whether the notification is enabled by calling the [GuiService:GetGameplayPausedNotificationEnabled](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/GuiService/GetGameplayPausedNotificationEnabled) function.
