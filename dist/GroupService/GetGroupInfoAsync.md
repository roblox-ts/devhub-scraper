Returns a table containing information about the given group.

The table returned is the same format as that returned in [GroupService:GetAlliesAsync](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/GroupService/GetAlliesAsync) and [GroupService:GetEnemiesAsync](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/GroupService/GetEnemiesAsync). This format can be seen below.

```lua
group = {
    Name = "Knights of the Seventh Sanctum",
    Id = 377251,
    Owner = {
        Name = "Vilicus",
        Id = 23415609
    },
    EmblemUrl = "http://www.roblox.com/asset/?id=60428602",
    Description = "We fight alongside the balance to make sure no one becomes to powerful",
    Roles = {
        [1] = {
            Name = "Apprentice",
            Rank = 1
        },
        [2] = {
            Name = "Warrior",
            Rank = 2
        },
        [3] = {
            Name = "Earth Walker",
            Rank = 255
        }
    }
}
``` 

Note, if a group has no owner the Owner field will be set to nil.

This function has a number of useful applications, including loading the latest description and logo of a group for display in a group base.
