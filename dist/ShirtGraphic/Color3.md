This property determines the colorization to be applied to the
[ShirtGraphic](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ShirtGraphic) texture. It functions similarly to [ImageLabel.ImageColor3](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ImageLabel#ImageColor3)
except that it is applied to [ShirtGraphic](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ShirtGraphic) textures. This is useful for
creating shirt graphics that have many different color variations but
share the same basic look.
