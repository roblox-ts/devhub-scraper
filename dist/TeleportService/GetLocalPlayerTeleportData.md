This function returns the teleport data the [Players.LocalPlayer](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Players/LocalPlayer) arrived with. It can only be called from the client.

Exploiters can spoof teleport data. Send secure data such as player currency through a server-side service such as \`DataStoreService\` to prevent tampering.
