This function returns the teleport data the [`Players.LocalPlayer`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Players#LocalPlayer)
arrived with. It can only be called from the client.

Exploiters can spoof teleport data. Send secure data such as player
currency through a server-side service such as [`DataStoreService`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DataStoreService) to
prevent tampering.
