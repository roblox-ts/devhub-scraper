TeleportService is responsible for transporting [`Player`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player)s between
different places and servers.

All teleporting functionality is consolidated into a single
[`TeleportService:TeleportAsync()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TeleportService#TeleportAsync) function, which is used to:

- Teleport players to a different place
- Teleport players to a specific server
- Teleport players to a reserved server

For more information on how to teleport players between servers, see
[Teleporting Between Places](https://create.roblox.com/docs/projects/teleporting).
