This function returns the [`PlaceId`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DataModel#PlaceId) and
[`JobId`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DataModel#JobId) of the server the user with the given
[`UserId`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player#UserId) is in, provided it is in the same game as the
current place.

Then, [`TeleportService:TeleportToPlaceInstance()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TeleportService#TeleportToPlaceInstance) can be called with
this information to allow a user to join the target user's server.

Upon a successful lookup, the function returns the following values:
| # | Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| **1** | currentInstance | bool | A bool indicating if the user was found in the current instance |
| **2** | error | string | An error message in the event of the lookup failing |
| **3** | placeId | int64 | The PlaceId of the server the user is in |
| **4** | instanceId | string | The JobId of the server the user is in |

If there is a problem during lookup, such as the user being offline, an
error is thrown. It is recommended that you wrap calls to this function in
`pcall`.
#### Limitations

You should be aware of the following limitations when using this function:

- This function can only be called by the server.
- This function may fail to return the correct information if the user is
teleporting.
- It is possible for this function to throw an error, hence developers
should wrap it in a `Global.LuaGlobals.pcall()` (see example below)
- As this function returns the JobId of the server and not the access code
returned by [`TeleportService:ReserveServer()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TeleportService#ReserveServer), the id returned is
not appropriate for use with reserved servers.

#### Studio limitation

This service does not work during playtesting in Roblox Studio â€” To
test aspects of your game using it, you must publish the game and play it
in the Roblox application.
