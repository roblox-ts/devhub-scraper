The ApplyLayout method forces sibling UI elements to be re-laid out in case the sorting criteria may have changed (such as when [UIGridStyleLayout.SortOrder](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/UIGridStyleLayout/SortOrder) is set to Custom, and the [UIGridStyleLayout:SetCustomSortFunction](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/UIGridStyleLayout/SetCustomSortFunction) behavior changed). Re-layouts automatically happen when UI elements are added/removed, or their [Instance.Name](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Instance/Name) or [GuiObject.LayoutOrder](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/GuiObject/LayoutOrder) change.

The manner in which sibling UI elements are laid out is dependent on the implementation of this abstract class. In other words, a concrete class like [UIListLayout](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/UIListLayout) or [UIGridLayout](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/UIGridLayout) is responsible for the actual element positioning.
