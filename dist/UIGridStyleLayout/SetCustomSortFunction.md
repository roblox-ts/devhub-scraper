$DESCRIPTION_SHORT The function should take two arguments (each will be an
Instance child to compare), and return true if a comes before b, otherwise
return false. In other words, use this function the same way you would use
a ' function. The sorting should be deterministic, otherwise sort will
fail and fall back to name order.
