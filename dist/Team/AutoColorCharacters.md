Historically set whether or not [Player](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player) character models on a team would
be colored to [Team.TeamColor](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Team#TeamColor).

Developers are advised not to use this property as the script which
changed the team colors has since been removed from the default character.
This property is deprecated and should not be used for new work.
