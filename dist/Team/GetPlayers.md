Returns a list of [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player)s who are assigned to the [Team](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Team). A [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player) is considered assigned if their [Player.Team](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Player/Team) property is equal to the [Team](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Team) and [Player.Neutral](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Player/Neutral) is false.

This function has a number of potential uses, including counting the number of players on a [Team](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Team) or giving every [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player) on a [Team](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Team) a [Tool](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Tool).
