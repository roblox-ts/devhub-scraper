This property sets the color of the [Team](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Team). Determines the [Player.TeamColor](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Player/TeamColor) property of players who are a member of the team.

A lot of Roblox's default team functionality is based on the team color, rather than the name or object. For example, [SpawnLocation](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/SpawnLocation)s can be assigned to a team via [SpawnLocation.TeamColor](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/SpawnLocation/TeamColor). For this reason it is recommended that developers ensure each [Team](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Team) has a unique TeamColor.

Any player which is a part of a team will have their name color changed to the team's TeamColor property. They will also be put underneath the team heading on the player list.
