**OffsetStudsU** determines how far the rendered texture is offset on the horizontal axis in studs.

Example

In the screenshots above, a Part with a Texture is visible. On the left, OffsetStudsU/OffsetStudsV are both 0, so the rendered texture tiling aligns with the top-left corner of the part. On the right, both properties are set to 1 which causes the tiling to start in the center of the texture.
