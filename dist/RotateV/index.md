A RotateV object joins two parts together and allows rotation about a set axis. This object is most commonly created by the Motor [SurfaceType](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/enum/SurfaceType). If created through a script, a RotateV's behavior is still governed by the SurfaceInput of [JointInstance.Part0](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/JointInstance/Part0).  
  
The three inputs of note are as follows:  
  

*   NoInput: The joint will not rotate under its own power. It can still be rotated by external forces (such as from a character pushing one of the parts).

*   Constant: The joint will rotate based on the ParamB property of \`JointInstance/Part0\`. This rotation is measured in radians per physics frame (which is approximately 1/60th of a second).
*   Sin: The joint will rotate based on the ParamA and ParamB properties of \`JointInstance/Part0\`. The rotation measured in radians per physics frame is calculated by the function: RotationRate = ParamA \* sin(distributedGameTime \* ParamB). distributedGameTime is the current time of the game measured in seconds.
