The position and rotation relative to its [`PVAdornment.Adornee`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PVAdornment#Adornee).
This CFrame is in the local space of the adornee, so forward (0,0,-1) will
be forward relative to the adornee. The offset and rotation of this CFrame
is applied after any translations due to
[`HandleAdornment.SizeRelativeOffset`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HandleAdornment#SizeRelativeOffset).
