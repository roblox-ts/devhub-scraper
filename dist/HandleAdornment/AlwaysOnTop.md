Forces this object to render on top of all 3d objects in the Workspace. Even if the adornment is behind a part based on its [HandleAdornment.CFrame](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/HandleAdornment/CFrame), if **AlwaysOnTop** is true then the adornment will still draw on top.

The one exception to this behavior is if the \`HandleAdornment/ZIndex\` of the adornment is set to -1. If this is the case, the adornment will always draw behind 3d geometry.
