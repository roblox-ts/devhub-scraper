The StarterCharacterScripts class stores scripts to be parented in a player's
[`Player.Character`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player#Character), when they spawn. Unlike scripts stored in the
[`PlayerScripts`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PlayerScripts) folder, these scripts will not persist when the player
respawns.

If a script named **Animate**, **Sound** or **Health** is placed in this
folder, they will replace the default scripts that are added to each
[`Player.Character`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player#Character) that is created.
