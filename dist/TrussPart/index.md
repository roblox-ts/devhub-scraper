Truss parts are the same as [`Parts`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Part), except that they have a
different visual style, resize differently and characters are able to climb
them. The smallest size it can be is 2x2x2 studs.

The [`style`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TrussPart#Style) of a truss beam can be set to change its
appearance.
