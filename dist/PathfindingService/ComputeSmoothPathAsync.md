This function computes and returns a smooth [`Path`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Path) between two
[`Vector3s`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/datatypes/Vector3). This function fulfills the same purpose as
[`PathfindingService:ComputeRawPathAsync()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PathfindingService#ComputeRawPathAsync), but creates a much
smoother path for an NPC to follow in comparison.
