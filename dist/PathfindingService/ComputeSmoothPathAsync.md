This function computes and returns a smooth [Path](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Path) between two [Vector3s](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/datatype/Vector3). This function fulfills the same purpose as [PathfindingService:ComputeRawPathAsync](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/PathfindingService/ComputeRawPathAsync), but creates a much smoother path for an NPC to follow in comparison.
