The DeviceAccelerationChanged event fires when a user moves a device that
has an accelerometer.

An accelerometer is a component found in most mobile devices that measures
acceleration (change in speed).

To determine whether a user's device has an accelerometer enabled,
see[`UserInputService.AccelerometerEnabled`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UserInputService#AccelerometerEnabled).

This event can be used to track the movement of a device that has an
accelerometer. A sample usage includes moving the player character when a
mobile device accelerates.

Additionally, this event can be used along with
[`UserInputService:GetDeviceAcceleration()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UserInputService#GetDeviceAcceleration) to determine the current
movement of a user's device if the device has an accelerometer.

This event only fires locally - which means that only the player whose
device moves can use the event and it will only work in a
[`LocalScript`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/LocalScript).
