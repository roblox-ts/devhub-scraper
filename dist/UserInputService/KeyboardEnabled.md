This property describes whether the user's device has a keyboard available. This property is _true_ when the user's device has an available keyboard, and _false_ when it does not.

It can be used to determine whether the user has an available keyboard - which can be important if you want to check if you can use [UserInputService:IsKeyDown](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/UserInputService/IsKeyDown) or [UserInputService:GetKeysPressed](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/UserInputService/GetKeysPressed) to check for keyboard input.

As [UserInputService](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/UserInputService) is client-side only, this property can only be used in a [LocalScript](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/LocalScript).
