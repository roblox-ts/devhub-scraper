The DeviceRotationChanged event fires when a user rotates a device that
has a gyroscope.

A gyroscope is an component found in most mobile devices that detects
orientation and rotational speed.

The event is useful when tracking the orientation of the device and how
changes as the user rotates their device. To determine the current device
rotation, you can use the [`UserInputService:GetDeviceRotation()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UserInputService#GetDeviceRotation)
function.

To check if a user's device has an enabled gyroscope, and that this event
will fire, see [`UserInputService.GyroscopeEnabled`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UserInputService#GyroscopeEnabled).

This event only fires when the Roblox client window is in focus. For
example, inputs will not be captured when the window is minimized.
