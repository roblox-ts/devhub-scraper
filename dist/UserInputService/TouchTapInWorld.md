The TouchTapInWorld event fires when the user touches/taps their finger on
the screen on a [`TouchEnabled`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UserInputService#TouchEnabled) device.
It is fired when the user taps in the game world.

This event can be used to determine when a user taps the screen and does
not tap a [`GUI`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiObject) element. If the user taps a GUI element,
[`UserInputService.TouchTap`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UserInputService#TouchTap) will fire instead of TouchTapInWorld.

To check if a user's device is TouchEnabled, and that touch events will
fire, see [`UserInputService.TouchEnabled`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UserInputService#TouchEnabled).

This event only fires when the Roblox client window is in focus. For
example, inputs will not be captured when the window is minimized.

As it only fires locally, it can only be used in a [`LocalScript`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/LocalScript).
