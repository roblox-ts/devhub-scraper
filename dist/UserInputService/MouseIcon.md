The **MouseIcon** property determines the image used as the pointer. If
blank, a default arrow is used. While the cursor hovers over certain UI
objects such as an [`ImageButton`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ImageButton), [`TextButton`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextButton),
[`TextBox`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextBox), or [`ProximityPrompt`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ProximityPrompt), this image will be overridden
and temporarily ignored.

To hide the cursor entirely, do **not** use a transparent image. Instead,
set [`UserInputService.MouseIconEnabled`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UserInputService#MouseIconEnabled) to false.
