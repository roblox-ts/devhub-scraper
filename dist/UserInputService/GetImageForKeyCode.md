This method takes the requested [`Enum.KeyCode`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/KeyCode) and returns the associated
image for the currently connected gamepad device (limited to Xbox,
PlayStation and Windows). This means that if the connected controller is a
XboxÂ One controller, the user sees Xbox assets. Similarly, if the
connected device is a PlayStation controller, the user sees PlayStation
assets. If you want to use custom assets, see
[`GetStringForKeyCode()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UserInputService#GetStringForKeyCode()).
