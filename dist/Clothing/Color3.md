This property determines the colorization to be applied to the [Clothing](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Clothing)
texture. The default colorization value is
[Color3.new(1,1,1) (white). When set to white no
colorization occurs

It functions similarly to ](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/datatype/Color3)ImageLabel/ImageColor3` and
`Decal/Color3`except that it is applied to Clothing textures.

It is useful for creating outfits that have many different color
variations, but share the same basic look, possibly for a character
creator in a roleplaying game or generating a lot of different varied
NPCs.

#### Examples

- Outfits that fade to different colors over time
- Outfits that have many different color variations, but share the same
  basic look
- A targeting texture that changes from red to blue when you target a
  specific type of object

The image below demonstrates the same shirt with two different
colorizations. The first shirt has a red colorization and the second shirt
has a blue colorization.
