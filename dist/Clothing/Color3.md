This property determines the colorization to be applied to the
[`Clothing`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Clothing) texture. The default colorization value is
[`Color3.new(1,1,1)`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/datatypes/Color3) (white). When set to white no
colorization occurs

It functions similarly to [`ImageLabel.ImageColor3`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ImageLabel#ImageColor3) and
[`Decal.Color3`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Decal#Color3) except that it is applied to Clothing textures.

It is useful for creating outfits that have many different color
variations, but share the same basic look, possibly for a character
creator in a roleplaying game or generating a lot of different varied
NPCs.
#### Examples

- Outfits that fade to different colors over time
- Outfits that have many different color variations, but share the same
basic look
- A targeting texture that changes from red to blue when you target a
specific type of object

The image below demonstrates the same shirt with two different
colorizations. The first shirt has a red colorization and the second shirt
has a blue colorization.
