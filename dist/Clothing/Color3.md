This property determines the colorization to be applied to the [Clothing](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Clothing) texture. The default colorization value is \`DataType/Color3|Color3.new(1,1,1) (white). When set to white no colorization occurs

It functions similarly to [ImageLabel.ImageColor3](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/ImageLabel/ImageColor3) and [Decal.Color3](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Decal/Color3)except that it is applied to Clothing textures.

It is useful for creating outfits that have many different color variations, but share the same basic look, possibly for a character creator in a roleplaying game or generating a lot of different varied NPCs.

### Examples

*   Outfits that fade to different colors over time
*   Outfits that have many different color variations, but share the same basic look
*   A targeting texture that changes from red to blue when you target a specific type of object

The image below demonstrates the same shirt with two different colorizations. The first shirt has a red colorization and the second shirt has a blue colorization.
