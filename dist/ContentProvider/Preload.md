Usually, content is loaded only when it starts being used. That explains why it often takes a moment for an image to appear in a [GUI](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/GuiObject), or a [mesh](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Mesh) to appear in a [part](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BasePart), or why a [sound](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Sound) doesn't play for the first time. All because the asset has not yet finished loading. Preload is used to load this content beforehand, so that it works instantly.
