A signal that fires when the [`Enum.AssetFetchStatus`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/AssetFetchStatus) of the provided
content changes. Connect to this signal by using a callback with one
argument of type [`Enum.AssetFetchStatus`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/AssetFetchStatus). This is particularly useful for
assets that might update themselves automatically like the thumbnail of a
user when they change clothes.
