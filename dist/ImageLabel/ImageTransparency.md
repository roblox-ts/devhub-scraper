ImageTransparency determines the alpha of a UI element's rendered image. A
value of 0 is completely opaque, and a value of 1 is completely
transparent (invisible). This property behaves similarly to
[GuiObject.BackgroundTransparency](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiObject#BackgroundTransparency) or [BasePart.Transparency](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#Transparency).
