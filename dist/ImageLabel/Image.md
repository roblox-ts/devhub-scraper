The Image property is a content-type property that should hold the asset
ID of a Decal or Image on the Roblox website. It functions identically to
[Decal.Texture](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Decal#Texture) with regards to loading the image from the Roblox website.
The rendered image will be colorized using [ImageLabel.ImageColor3](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ImageLabel#ImageColor3). It is
possible to make the image render as tiled, scaled to fit, or 9-sliced, by
adjusting the [ImageLabel.ScaleType](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ImageLabel#ScaleType) property.
