The Image property is a content-type property that should hold the asset ID of a Decal or Image on the Roblox website. It functions identically to [Decal.Texture](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Decal/Texture) with regards to loading the image from the Roblox website. The rendered image will be colorized using [ImageLabel.ImageColor3](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/ImageLabel/ImageColor3). It is possible to make the image render as tiled, scaled to fit, or 9-sliced, by adjusting the [ImageLabel.ScaleType](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/ImageLabel/ScaleType) property.
