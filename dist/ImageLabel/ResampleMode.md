Determines how the image looks when it is scaled.

By default, the image smooths out texture when displayed on the screen
larger or smaller than its size in texture memory. When set to
[`Enum.ResamplerMode.Pixelated`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/ResamplerMode), the image
preserves the sharp edges of pixels.
