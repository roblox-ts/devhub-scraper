A **UnionOperation** is the result of individual parts that have been joined
together into a single solid model through Studio's solid modeling **Union**
tool, or through [`BasePart:UnionAsync()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#UnionAsync) or
[`BasePart:SubtractAsync()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#SubtractAsync).
