The MembershipType [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player) property can be used to determine the membership type of the player. It holds a [MembershipType](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/enum/MembershipType) enum of the account's membership type.

This property can only be read from to determine membership (it cannot be set to another membership type). The property can only be changed via [CoreScript](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/CoreScript)s using [Player:SetMembershipType](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Player/SetMembershipType) - which are not accessible.
