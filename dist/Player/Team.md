The Team property is a reference to a [Team](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Team) object within the [Teams](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Teams) service. It determines the team the player is on; if the [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player) isn't on a team or has an invalid [Player.TeamColor](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Player/TeamColor), this property is nil. When this property is set, the player has joined the [Team](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Team) and the [Team.PlayerAdded](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/Team/PlayerAdded) event fires on the associated team. Similarly, [Team.PlayerRemoved](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/Team/PlayerRemoved) fires when the property is unset from a certain [Team](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Team).
