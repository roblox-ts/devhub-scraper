The UserId is a [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player) property that contains a read-only integer that **uniquely and consistently** identifies every user account on Roblox. Unlike the [Instance.Name](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Instance/Name) of a Player, which may change according the user's present username, this value will never change for the same account.

This property is essential when saving/loading player data using [GlobalDataStores](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/GlobalDataStore). Use a player's UserId as the data store key so that each player has a unique key.
