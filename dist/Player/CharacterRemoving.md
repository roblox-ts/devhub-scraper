The CharacterRemoving event fires right before a player's character is removed, such as when the player is respawning.

This event can be used alongside the [Player.CharacterAdded](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/Player/CharacterAdded) event, which fires when a player's character spawns or respawns. For instance, if you would like print a message every time a player spawns and dies:

```lua
local Players = game:GetService("Players")

local function onCharacterSpawned(player)
    print(player.Name .. " is spawning")
end

local function onCharacterDespawned(player)
    print(player.Name .. " is despawning")
end

local function onPlayerAdded(player)
    player.CharacterAdded:Connect(function ()
        onCharacterDespawned(player)
    end)
    player.CharacterRemoving:Connect(function ()
        onCharacterDespawned(player)
    end)
end

Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(onPlayerAdded)
```

This event is only concerned with the [Character](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Player/Character) of a [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player). If you instead need to track when a player joins/leaves the game, use the events [Players.PlayerAdded](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/Players/PlayerAdded) and [Players.PlayerRemoving](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/Players/PlayerRemoving).
