The CameraMinZoonDistance [Player](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player) property sets the minimum distance in
studs the camera can be from the character with the default cameras.

In other words, it controls the minimum distance the player's camera is
allowed to zoom in.

The default value of this property is set by
[StarterPlayer.CameraMinZoomDistance](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/StarterPlayer#CameraMinZoomDistance). If this value is set to a higher
value than [Player.CameraMaxZoomDistance](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player#CameraMaxZoomDistance) it will be decreased to
CameraMaxZoomDistance.
