The CameraMinZoonDistance [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player) property sets the minimum distance in studs the camera can be from the character with the default cameras.

In other words, it controls the minimum distance the player's camera is allowed to zoom in.

The default value of this property is set by [StarterPlayer.CameraMinZoomDistance](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/StarterPlayer/CameraMinZoomDistance). If this value is set to a higher value than [Player.CameraMaxZoomDistance](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Player/CameraMaxZoomDistance) it will be decreased to CameraMaxZoomDistance.
