The SetAccountAge function sets the [Player.AccountAge](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Player/AccountAge) of the player in days.

It is used to set the [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player) property that describes how long ago a player's account was registered in days.

This does not set the age of the player on the account, but the age of the account itself relative to when it was first created.
