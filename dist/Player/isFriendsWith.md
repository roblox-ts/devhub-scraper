This function sends a request to the Roblox website asking whether a player is a friend of another user, given the [Player.UserId](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Player/UserId) of that user. This function caches results so multiple calls of the function on the same player with the same `userId` may not yield the most up-to-date result. This does not happen when used in a [LocalScript](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/LocalScript).
