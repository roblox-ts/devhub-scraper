The Chatted event fires when a [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player) types a message and presses enter in Roblox's provided chat bar. This is done using some Lua bindings by the default chat script. You can prevent players from chatting by using [StarterGui:SetCoreGuiEnabled](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/StarterGui/SetCoreGuiEnabled) and disabling the Chat [CoreGuiType](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/enum/CoreGuiType).

Chat Commands
-------------

Using this event and some string manipulation functions like `string.sub` and `string.lower`, it is possible to create chat commands, even with arguments like player names. Usually, commands are prefixed such as `/heal PlayerName`. To check for a prefix in a string, use `string.sub` on the message to check a substring of the message: `string.sub(message, 1, 6) == "/heal "` (note the inclusion of the space) . Then, extract the rest of the command using `string.sub` again: `string.sub(message, 7)` will be equal to the player name. Check if that player exists, and if so, perform the command's action (in this example, healing them). Check the code samples for examples of chat commands.

Filtering
---------

The message text fired with this event is **unfiltered**. If you are displaying player input like chat to other players in any form, it must be filtered using [Chat:FilterStringAsync](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Chat/FilterStringAsync). Keep this in mind when creating your own chat systems; if your game does not properly filter chat it may have moderation action taken against it.
