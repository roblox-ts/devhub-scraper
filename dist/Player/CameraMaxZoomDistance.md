The CameraMaxZoomDistance [Player](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player) property sets the maximum distance in
studs the camera can be from the character with the default cameras.

In other words, it controls the maximum distance the player's camera is
allowed to zoom out.

The default value of this property is set by
[StarterPlayer.CameraMaxZoomDistance](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/StarterPlayer#CameraMaxZoomDistance). If this value is set to a lower
value than [Player.CameraMinZoomDistance](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player#CameraMinZoomDistance), it will be increased to
CameraMinZoomDistance.
