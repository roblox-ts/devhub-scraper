The LocaleId [Player](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player) property shows the locale id that the local player
has set for their Roblox account. It holds a string with the two letter
code (for example, "en-us") for the locale.

This can be used to determine the geographic demographic of your game's
player base.

This property allows access to the player's locale from the server. It is
similar to [LocalizationService](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/LocalizationService)'s [LocalizationService.RobloxLocaleId](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/LocalizationService#RobloxLocaleId)
property.
