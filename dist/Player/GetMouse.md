The GetMouse [`Player`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player) function returns the [`Mouse`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Mouse) being used
by the client. The player's mouse instance can be used to track user mouse
input including left and right mouse button clicks and movement and
location.

The [`UserInputService`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UserInputService) service provides additional functions and
events to track user input - especially for devices that do not use a
mouse.

Note:

- This item **must** be used in a [`LocalScript`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/LocalScript) to work as expected
online.
- Following an update in July 2014, the mouse's icon can now be set with
this method.
