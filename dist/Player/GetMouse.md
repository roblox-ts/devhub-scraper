The GetMouse [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player) function returns the [Mouse](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Mouse) being used by the client. The player's mouse instance can be used to track user mouse input including left and right mouse button clicks and movement and location.

The [UserInputService](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/UserInputService) service provides additional functions and events to track user input - especially for devices that do not use a mouse.

Notes

*   This item **must** be used in a [LocalScript](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/LocalScript) to work as expected online.
*   Following an update in July 2014, the mouse's icon can now be set with this method.
