The Neutral property determines whether the player is on a specific team.

*   When _true_, the player is not on a specific team. This also means that the [Player.Team](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Player/Team) property will be nil and the [Player.TeamColor](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Player/TeamColor) will be white.
*   When _false_, the player is on a specific team. The [Player.Team](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Player/Team) property will correspond to the [Team](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Team) that the player is on, as will the [Player.TeamColor](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Player/TeamColor).
