The HasAppearanceLoaded [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player) function returns whether or not the appearance of the player's [Player.Character](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Player/Character) has loaded.

A player's appearance includes items such as the player's [Shirt](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Shirt), [Pants](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Pants), and [Accessories](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Accessory).

This is useful when determining whether a player's appearance has loaded after they first join the game, which can be tracked using the [Players.PlayerAdded](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/Players/PlayerAdded) event.
