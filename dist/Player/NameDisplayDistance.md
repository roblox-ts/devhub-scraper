The NameDisplayDistance [`StarterPlayer`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/StarterPlayer) property sets the distance
in studs at which this player will see other [`Humanoid`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid)'s names. If
the property is set to 0, names are hidden. This property is set to
[`StarterPlayer.NameDisplayDistance`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/StarterPlayer#NameDisplayDistance) by default.

If a Humanoid's health bar is visible, you can set the display type using
[`Humanoid.DisplayDistanceType`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid#DisplayDistanceType).
