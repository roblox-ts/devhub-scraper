This event is usually fired two minutes after the game engine classifies
the [`player`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player) as idle. Time is the amount of seconds since
this point.

This can be used to track when a player has been idled for approximately
two minutes - which can be useful for implementing away from keyboard
(AFK) features into a game.

When the game engine classifies a player as idle, this event is called
after two minutes. After every check, if the player is still idled, the
event will continue to fire until the check reveals the player is no
longer idle.

This event is used by Roblox to automatically disconnect players that have
been idle for at least 20 minutes. If you would like to track when this
disconnect occurs, consider using [`Players.PlayerRemoving`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Players#PlayerRemoving) alongside
this event.
