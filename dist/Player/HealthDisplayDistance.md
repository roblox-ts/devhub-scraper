The HealthDisplayDistance [`Player`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player) property sets the distance in
studs at which this player will see other [`Humanoid`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid)'s health bars.
If set to 0, the health bars will not be displayed. This property is set
to [`StarterPlayer.HealthDisplayDistance`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/StarterPlayer#HealthDisplayDistance) by default.

If a Humanoid's health bar is visible, you can set the display type using
[`Humanoid.DisplayDistanceType`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid#DisplayDistanceType).
