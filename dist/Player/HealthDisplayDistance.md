The HealthDisplayDistance [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player) property sets the distance in studs at which this player will see other [Humanoid](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Humanoid)'s health bars. If set to 0, the health bars will not be displayed. This property is set to [StarterPlayer.HealthDisplayDistance](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/StarterPlayer/HealthDisplayDistance) by default.

Note
----

If a Humanoid's health bar is visible, you can set the display type using [Humanoid.DisplayDistanceType](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Humanoid/DisplayDistanceType).
