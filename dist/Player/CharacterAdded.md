The **CharacterAdded** event fires when a player's character spawns (orÂ respawns). This event fires soon after setting [Player.Character](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Player/Character) to a non-`nil` value or calling [Player:LoadCharacter](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Player/LoadCharacter), which is before the character is parented to the [Workspace](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Workspace).

This can be used alongside the [Player.CharacterRemoving](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/Player/CharacterRemoving) event, which fires right before a player's character is about to be removed, typically after death. As such, both of these events can potentially fire many times as players die then respawn in a place. If you want to detect when a player joins or leaves the game, use the [Players.PlayerAdded](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/Players/PlayerAdded) and [Players.PlayerRemoving](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/Players/PlayerRemoving) events instead.

Note that the [Humanoid](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Humanoid) and its default body parts (head, torso, and limbs) will exist when this event fires, but clothing items like [Hats](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Hat) and [Shirts](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Shirt), and [Pants](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Pants) may take a few seconds to be added to the character. Connect [Instance.ChildAdded](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/Instance/ChildAdded) on the added character to detect these, or wait for the [Player.CharacterAppearanceLoaded](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/Player/CharacterAppearanceLoaded) event to be sure the character has everything equipped.
