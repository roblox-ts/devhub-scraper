**GetNetworkPing** returns the engine-calculated latency of the [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player) in seconds. “Ping” is a measurement of the time taken for data to be sent from the client to the server, then back again. For client-side [LocalScript](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/LocalScript)s, this function may only be called on the [LocalPlayer](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Players/LocalPlayer). This function is useful in identifying and debugging issues that occur in high-latency scenarios. It can also be used in masking latency, such as adjusting the speed of throwing animations for projectiles.
