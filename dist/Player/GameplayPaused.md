The **GameplayPaused** property indicates if the player is currently in a pause state in a place with [StreamingEnabled](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Workspace/StreamingEnabled) activated. It is set on the client but replicated to the server.

To determine the pause status, you can utilize this property as outlined [here](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/content-streaming#customizing-pause-screen).
