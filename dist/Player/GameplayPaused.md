The **GameplayPaused** property indicates if the player is currently in a
pause state in a place with [StreamingEnabled](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Workspace#StreamingEnabled)
activated. It is set on the client but replicated to the server. To
determine the pause status, you can utilize this property.
