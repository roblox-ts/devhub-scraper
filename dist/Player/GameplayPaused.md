The **GameplayPaused** property indicates if the player is currently in a
pause state in a place with
[`StreamingEnabled`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Workspace#StreamingEnabled) activated. It is set
on the client but replicated to the server. To determine the pause status,
you can utilize this property.
