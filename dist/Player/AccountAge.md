The AccountAge is a [`Player`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player) property that describes how long ago a
player's account was registered in days. It is set using the
[`Player:SetAccountAge()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player#SetAccountAge) function, which cannot be accessed by
scripts.

This property is useful for conditionally showing new Roblox players
content such as tutorials.
