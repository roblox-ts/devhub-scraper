The AccountAge is a [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player) property that describes how long ago a player's account was registered in days. It is set using the [Player:SetAccountAge](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Player/SetAccountAge) function, which cannot be accessed by scripts.

This property is useful for conditionally showing new Roblox players content such as tutorials.
