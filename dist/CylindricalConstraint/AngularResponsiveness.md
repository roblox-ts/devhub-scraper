This property specifies the sharpness of the angular servo motor in
reaching the [CylindricalConstraint.TargetAngle](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/CylindricalConstraint#TargetAngle), when
[CylindricalConstraint.AngularActuatorType](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/CylindricalConstraint#AngularActuatorType) is set to **Servo**. Larger
values correspond to a faster response and smaller values results in more
damping and a slower response.
