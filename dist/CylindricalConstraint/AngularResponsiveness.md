This property specifies the sharpness of the angular servo motor in
reaching the [`TargetAngle`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/CylindricalConstraint#TargetAngle), when
[`AngularActuatorType`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/CylindricalConstraint#AngularActuatorType) is
set to [`Servo`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/ActuatorType). Larger values correspond to a faster
response and smaller values results in more damping and a slower response.
