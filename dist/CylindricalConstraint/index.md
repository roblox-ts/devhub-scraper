A **CylindricalConstraint** allows its attachments to slide along one axis and rotate about another axis. It can be thought of like a combination of a [PrismaticConstraint](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/PrismaticConstraint) and a [HingeConstraint](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/HingeConstraint). The sliding axis is determined by the **X** axis of the constraint's [Constraint.Attachment0](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Constraint/Attachment0). The rotation axis is centered at the constraint's [Constraint.Attachment1](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Constraint/Attachment1) and is angled off of the sliding constraint by the constraint's [CylindricalConstraint.InclinationAngle](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/CylindricalConstraint/InclinationAngle).

This constraint, along with a [SpringConstraint](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/SpringConstraint), is ideal for building vehicle suspension as demonstrated in `/articles/building carkit 1|Building a Basic Car`.

Note that if this constraint attaches one part (**A**) to another part (**B**) that is anchored or connected to an anchored part (**Z**), part **A** will not be locally simulated when interacting with a player.
