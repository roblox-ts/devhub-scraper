A **RodConstraint** constrains two [Attachments](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Attachment) to remain separated by the value specified by [RodConstraint.Length](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/RodConstraint/Length). While the attachments remain at a set distance from one another, they can both rotate freely.

Note that if this constraint attaches one part (**A**) to another part (**B**) that is anchored or connected to an anchored part (**Z**), part **A** will not be locally simulated when interacting with a player.
