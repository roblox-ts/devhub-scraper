A **RodConstraint** constrains two [Attachments](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Attachment) to remain separated by the value specified by [RodConstraint.Length](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/RodConstraint/Length). While the attachments remain at a set distance from one another, they can both rotate freely.

By default, RodConstraints do not have angle constraints and allow each part to rotate without angular constraint. However, setting [LimitsEnabled](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/RodConstraint/LimitsEnabled) reveal the [LimitAngle0](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/RodConstraint/LimitAngle0) and [LimitAngle1](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/RodConstraint/LimitAngle1) properties, which control the maximum angle that either end of the rod may have against the respective attachment. In the image below, the two parts are joined by a RodConstraint with 45 degree limits on each end. The red part is not [Anchored](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BasePart/Anchored).

Note that if this constraint attaches one part (**A**) to another part (**B**) that is anchored or connected to an anchored part (**Z**), part **A** will not be locally simulated when interacting with a player.
