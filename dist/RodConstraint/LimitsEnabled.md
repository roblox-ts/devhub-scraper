**LimitsEnabled** determines whether the [LimitAngle0](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/RodConstraint/LimitAngle0) and [LimitAngle1](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/RodConstraint/LimitAngle1) properties control the angles between the rod and the respective attachments, as well as whether those properties are visible in the Properties window in Studio.

In the image below, the two parts are joined by a RodConstraint with 45 degree limits on each end. The red part is not [Anchored](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BasePart/Anchored).
