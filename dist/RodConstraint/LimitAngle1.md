**LimitAngle1** determines the maximum angle between the rod and
[Attachment1](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Constraint#Attachment1) when
[LimitsEnabled](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/RodConstraint#LimitsEnabled) is true. Otherwise, this
property is hidden in the Properties window and does nothing.

In the image below, the two parts are joined by a RodConstraint with 45
degree limits on each end. The red part is not
[Anchored](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#Anchored).
