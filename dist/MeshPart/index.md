[`MeshPart`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/MeshPart) is a form of [`BasePart`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart) that includes a physically
simulated custom mesh. Unlike with other mesh classes, such as
[`SpecialMesh`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SpecialMesh) and [`BlockMesh`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BlockMesh), they are not parented to a
[`BasePart`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart) but rather behave as a [`BasePart`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart) in their own right.

The mesh and texture of a [`MeshPart`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/MeshPart) are determined by the
[`MeshId`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/MeshPart#MeshId) and [`TextureID`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/MeshPart#TextureID)
properties. For more information, see [Meshes](https://create.roblox.com/docs/parts/meshes).
