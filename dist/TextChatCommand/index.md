Represents a text chat command. Can be used to create custom text chat
commands when parented to [`TextChatService`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextChatService). Custom commands can have up
to two aliases, and the Triggered event fires when a user types
"/{PrimaryAlias}" or "/{SecondaryAlias}" into the chat.
