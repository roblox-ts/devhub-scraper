Determines the vertical alignment of the chat window. Behaves similarly to
[`UIGridStyleLayout.VerticalAlignment`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UIGridStyleLayout#VerticalAlignment). Setting to `Top` or `Bottom`
adds a small padding away from touching the corresponding edge of the
screen. Setting to Center aligns the window in the vertical middle of the
screen. Default value is `Top`.
