Determines the background color of the default chat window. If the
background color is not overridden, this value will respect the user's
[`GuiService.PreferredTransparency`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiService#PreferredTransparency) by making the menu more gray as
the transparency of the menu decreases. Default value is
`Datatype.Color3|Color3.new(25,27,29)`.
