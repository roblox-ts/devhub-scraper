**Path** objects store the result of paths created by `PathfindingService/CreatePath|PathfindingService:CreatePath()`.

Once a path object is created, you can call `Path/ComputeAsync|Path:ComputeAsync()` with a starting point and ending point. This will attempt to compute a valid path for a character to move along, based on default or custom parameters passed to `PathfindingService/CreatePath|CreatePath()`. If `Path/ComputeAsync|ComputeAsync()` successfully finds a path, the [Path](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Path) object will have a [Path.Status](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Path/Status) value of `Enum.PathStatus.Success`. Otherwise the status will be `Enum.PathStatus.NoPath` which can occur if there are obstacles between the two points (and no way around) or if the points are inside of solid objects.

In addition to `Path/ComputeAsync|ComputeAsync()`, [Path](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Path) objects have the `Path/GetWaypoints|GetWaypoints()` method which returns a list of waypoints representing the points a character should follow in sequence to get from the beginning to the end of the path.

Finally, [Path](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Path) objects can be **connected** to the `Path/Blocked|Path.Blocked` event. This event will fire if, at any time during the path's existence, the path is blocked. Note that this can occur **behind** a character moving along the path, not just in front of it.

See the `Articles/Pathfinding|Pathfinding` guide for details and examples on using pathfinding in Roblox.
