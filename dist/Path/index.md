**Path** objects store the result of paths created by [PathfindingService:CreatePath()](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/PathfindingService/CreatePath).

Once a path object is created, you can call [Path:ComputeAsync()](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Path/ComputeAsync) with a starting point and ending point. This will attempt to compute a valid path for a character to move along, based on default or custom parameters passed to [CreatePath()](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/PathfindingService/CreatePath). If [ComputeAsync()](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Path/ComputeAsync) successfully finds a path, the [Path](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Path) object will have a [Path.Status](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Path/Status) value of `Enum.PathStatus.Success`. Otherwise the status will be `Enum.PathStatus.NoPath` which can occur if there are obstacles between the two points (and no way around) or if the points are inside of solid objects.

In addition to [ComputeAsync()](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Path/ComputeAsync), [Path](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Path) objects have the [GetWaypoints()](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Path/GetWaypoints) method which returns a list of waypoints representing the points a character should follow in sequence to get from the beginning to the end of the path.

Finally, [Path](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Path) objects can be **connected** to the [Path.Blocked](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/Path/Blocked) event. This event will fire if, at any time during the path's existence, the path is blocked. Note that this can occur **behind** a character moving along the path, not just in front of it.
