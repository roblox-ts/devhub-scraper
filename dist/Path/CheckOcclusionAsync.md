This function checks if a path is blocked starting at the waypoint
indicated by **start**.

It returns the first waypoint of occlusion if blocked, -1 if not. it
returns an error if **start** is less than 0 or greater than the number of
waypoints in the [`Path`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Path).
