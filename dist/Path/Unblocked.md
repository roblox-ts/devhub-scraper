Fires when a computed path that was blocked becomes unblocked. Note that a
blocked path may become unblocked somewhere **behind** the agent,
effectively making reaction to this event unnecessary. See
[Handling Blocked Paths](https://create.roblox.com/docs/characters/pathfinding#handling-blocked-paths)
for details on checking the forward waypoint progress of an agent along a
path.
