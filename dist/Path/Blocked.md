Fires when the computed path becomes blocked. Note that paths may become
blocked somewhere **behind** the agent, such as a pile of rubble falling
on a path as the agent runs away. See
[Handling Blocked Paths](https://create.roblox.com/docs/characters/pathfinding#handling-blocked-paths)
for details on checking the forward waypoint progress of an agent along a
path.
