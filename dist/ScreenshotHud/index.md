The [`ScreenshotHud`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ScreenshotHud) is a 2D user interface that allows users to capture
and save screenshots to their local device. It consists of the following UI
elements:

- An overlay containing the experience name and Roblox branding. These remain
on screen when a screenshot is taken, although the experience name can be
disabled through the [`ScreenshotHud.ExperienceNameOverlayEnabled`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ScreenshotHud#ExperienceNameOverlayEnabled)
property.
- A camera button that hides all UI except for the overlay and takes a
screenshot.
- A close button that closes the [`ScreenshotHud`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ScreenshotHud).
