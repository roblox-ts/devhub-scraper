The TextStrokeColor3 property sets the color of the stroke, or outline, of
rendered text. This property and [`TextLabel.TextStrokeTransparency`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextLabel#TextStrokeTransparency)
determine the visual properties of the text stroke.

Text stroke is rendered before normal text and is simply 4 renderings of
the same text in +/- 1 pixel offsets in each direction. Text stroke
rendering works independently and identically to
[`TextLabel.TextColor3`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextLabel#TextColor3) and [`TextLabel.TextTransparency`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextLabel#TextTransparency).
