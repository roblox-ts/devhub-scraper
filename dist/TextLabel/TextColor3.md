This property determines the color of all the text rendered by a
[`GUI`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextLabel) element. This property along with
[`TextLabel.Font`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextLabel#Font), [`TextLabel.TextSize`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextLabel#TextSize) and
[`TextLabel.TextTransparency`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextLabel#TextTransparency) will determine the visual properties of
text. Text is rendered after the text stroke
([`TextLabel.TextStrokeColor3`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextLabel#TextStrokeColor3)).

It's important that text is easily read by players! Be sure to choose
colors with little-to-no saturation, like white, grey, or black. Make sure
the color of your text is contrasted by the
[`TextLabel.BackgroundColor3`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextLabel#BackgroundColor3) of the GUI element. If the element has
a transparent background, try applying a black
[`TextLabel.TextStrokeColor3`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextLabel#TextStrokeColor3) to help contrast the text with the 3D
world behind it.
