GuiLabel is an abstract class that inherits from [GuiObject](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/GuiObject). It is the base class for [ImageLabel](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ImageLabel) and [TextLabel](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/TextLabel). Unlike [GuiButton](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/GuiButton), objects of this type will not register click events, but instead serve as non-interactive labels. It does not implement any further properties, events or methods.
