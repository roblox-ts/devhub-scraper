GuiLabel is an abstract class that inherits from [GuiObject](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiObject). It is the base
class for [ImageLabel](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ImageLabel) and [TextLabel](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextLabel). Unlike [GuiButton](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiButton), objects of this
type will not register click events, but instead serve as non-interactive
labels. It does not implement any further properties, events or methods.
