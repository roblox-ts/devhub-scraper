The ReverbSoundEffect simulates the effect of sounds bouncing off of several surfaces (such as walls in a room), which causes several overlapping echoes that arrive at the listener at slightly offset times.  
  
Like all other [SoundEffect](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/SoundEffect), a ChorusSoundEffect can be applied either to a [Sound](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Sound) or [SoundGroup](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/SoundGroup) by being parented to either.
