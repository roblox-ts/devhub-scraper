The ReverbSoundEffect simulates the effect of sounds bouncing off of several
surfaces (such as walls in a room), which causes several overlapping echoes
that arrive at the listener at slightly offset times.

Like all other [`SoundEffect`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SoundEffect)s, a ReverbSoundEffect can be applied either
to a [`Sound`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Sound) or [`SoundGroup`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SoundGroup) by being parented to either.
