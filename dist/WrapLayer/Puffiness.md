Controls how much underlying clothing items inflate the current clothing
item.

Valid range is 0 to 1. A value of 0 makes the clothing item always fit the
body regardless of how many clothing layers are under it (all underlying
clothing layers will be compressed). A value of 1 (default) never
compresses anything and infinitely inflates over underlying clothing
items.
