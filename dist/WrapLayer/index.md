The WrapLayer object defines a 3D accessory's inner and outer surfaces and other properties related to layering accessories. These surfaces, or the Inner Cage and Outer Cage, are similar to collision boxes, and describe the surfaces of which other 3D accessories can be placed without clipping or breaking.

Internally, WrapLayer also uses the UV layout of the Inner and Outer cages to match coordinates to another 3D object's cage. This powers the deformation of objects around differently shaped avatars and underlying accessories.
