AssetID for reference mesh used to define Inner Cage of a 3D object

Reference mesh is used to define standard topology and UV coordinates for
index matching. It is expected that for all catalog avatars, this will
point to one of 15 standard reference meshes provided by Roblox. But for
some NPCs or a custom avatar system, this might point to other meshes.

Note: this property is set up automatically by the FBX importer
