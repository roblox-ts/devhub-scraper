![A default rig wearing a very dapper Shirt (rbxassetid://86896487)](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/bltc8da647cb0295112/Shirt.jpg) The **Shirt** object displays a Shirt texture from the Roblox website on a [Humanoid](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Humanoid) rig. Shirts cover the torso and arms, and will take priority over a [Pants](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Pants) on the torso. To be visible, a Shirt must be a sibling of a Humanoid and have its [ShirtTemplate](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Shirt/ShirtTemplate) property set to an appropriate texture (such as `rbxassetid://86896487`, pictured to the right). The shirt texture may be colorized using the [Clothing.Color3](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Clothing/Color3) property.

Shirts are automatically loaded on [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player) characters if their avatar is wearing one.
