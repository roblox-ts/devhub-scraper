Read-only property that includes information on how the interpolation of the [Tween](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Tween) is to be carried out, using the `TweenInfo` data type. The TweenInfo data type includes a range of properties that can be used to achieve various styles of animation, including reversing and looping [Tween](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Tween)s (see examples).

As with all [Tween](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Tween) properties, the TweenInfo property is read only. If a developer wants to modify the TweenInfo of a Tween they must create a new [Tween](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Tween) using [TweenService:Create](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/TweenService/Create).
