The Instance property of a [Tween](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Tween) points to the [Instance](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Instance) whose properties are being interpolated by the tween. As with all [Tween](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Tween) properties, the Instance property is read only. If a developer wants to tween a different instance they must create a new [Tween](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Tween) using [TweenService:Create](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/TweenService/Create).
