The Instance property of a [Tween](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Tween) points to the [Instance](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance) whose
properties are being interpolated by the tween. As with all [Tween](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Tween)
properties, the Instance property is read only. If a developer wants to
tween a different instance they must create a new [Tween](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Tween) using
[TweenService:Create](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TweenService#Create).
