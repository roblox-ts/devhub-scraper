This field controls whether debugger will stop on the breakpoint or not.  
It is used together with the [DebuggerBreakpoint.LogExpression](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DebuggerBreakpoint#LogExpression) to log a
message when breakpoint is hit, without pausing into the debugger to act
as a 'logpoint' instead of a 'breakpoint'.
