This field controls whether debugger will stop on the breakpoint or not.  
It is used together with the [DebuggerBreakpoint.LogExpression](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/DebuggerBreakpoint/LogExpression) to log a message when breakpoint is hit, without pausing into the debugger to act as a 'logpoint' instead of a 'breakpoint'.
