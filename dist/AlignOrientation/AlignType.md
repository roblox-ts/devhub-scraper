Specifies the desired relationship between the primary axes of
[`Attachment0`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Constraint#Attachment0) and the goal. Options are
either `Enum.AlignType|Parallel` or `Enum.AlignType|Perpendicular` and the
constraint will attempt to maintain the specified relationship by applying
forces within two parallel or perpendicular axes, respectively. Only
meaningful if [`PrimaryAxisOnly`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignOrientation#PrimaryAxisOnly) is
true.
