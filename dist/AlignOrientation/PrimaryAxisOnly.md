If true, the [AlignOrientation](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignOrientation) applies torque if the primary axis of its
[Attachment0](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Constraint#Attachment0) becomes unaligned with the goal. This
means that any rotation about the Attachment0's primary axis will not
create a torque.
