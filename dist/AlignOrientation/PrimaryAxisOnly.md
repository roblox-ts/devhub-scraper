If true, the [AlignOrientation](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/AlignOrientation) applies torque if the primary axis of its [Attachment0](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Constraint/Attachment0) becomes unaligned with the goal. This means that any rotation about the Attachment0's primary axis will not create a torque.
