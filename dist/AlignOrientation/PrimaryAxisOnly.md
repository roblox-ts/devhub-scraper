Determines how the constraint's axes are affected by torque. If false
(default), the constraint will apply torque about all 3Â axes to
achieve alignment. If true, torque will only occur when the primary axes
become misaligned.

Enabling [`PrimaryAxisOnly`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignOrientation#PrimaryAxisOnly) also
enables the [`AlignType`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignOrientation#AlignType) property.
