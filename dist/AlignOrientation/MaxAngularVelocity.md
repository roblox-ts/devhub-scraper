Maximum angular velocity the constraint can use to reach its goal. Only
used if [`RigidityEnabled`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignOrientation#RigidityEnabled) is false.

Note that [`MaxAngularVelocity`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignOrientation#MaxAngularVelocity),
as well as [`MaxTorque`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignOrientation#MaxTorque), are **caps** to
the angular velocity and torque respectively. The actual scale is
determined by [`Responsiveness`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignOrientation#Responsiveness).
