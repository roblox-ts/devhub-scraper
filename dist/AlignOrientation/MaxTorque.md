Maximum torque the constraint can use to reach its goal. Only used if
[`RigidityEnabled`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignOrientation#RigidityEnabled) is false.

Note that [`MaxTorque`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignOrientation#MaxTorque), as well as
[`MaxAngularVelocity`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignOrientation#MaxAngularVelocity), are
**caps** to the torque and angular velocity respectively. The actual scale
is determined by [`Responsiveness`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignOrientation#Responsiveness).
