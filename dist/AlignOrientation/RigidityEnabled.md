Whether torque is dependent on other properties, or if the physics solver
reacts as quickly as possible to complete the alignment. If false
(default), the torque is determined by
[`MaxTorque`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignOrientation#MaxTorque),
[`MaxAngularVelocity`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignOrientation#MaxAngularVelocity), and
[`Responsiveness`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignOrientation#Responsiveness). If true, the
physics solver reacts as quickly as possible to complete the alignment.
