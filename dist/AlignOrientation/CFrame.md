The orientation of the `CFrame` determines the goal orientation of the
[AlignOrientation](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignOrientation) when its [Mode](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignOrientation#Mode) is
[OneAttachment](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/enum/OrientationAlignmentMode). The translation component
of the `CFrame` is ignored.
