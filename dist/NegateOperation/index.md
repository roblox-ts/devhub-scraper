A **NegateOperation** is the result of a part that has been negated through
Studio's solid modeling **Negate** tool.

A negated part turns pink and translucent as an indicator of its state. If the
negated part is then unioned with a normal part using the **Union** tool,
sections where the negated part overlaps the normal part will be cut out.

Note that you can undo part negation by selecting the negated part and
clicking **Negate** again.
