The [Animation](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Animation) object that was used to create this [AnimationTrack](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AnimationTrack). To
create an [AnimationTrack](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AnimationTrack) the developer must load an [Animation](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Animation) object
onto a [Humanoid](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid) or [AnimationController](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AnimationController) using the
[Humanoid:LoadAnimation](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid#LoadAnimation) method.

The Animation property is used to identify the underlying [Animation](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Animation) of
an [AnimationTrack](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AnimationTrack).
