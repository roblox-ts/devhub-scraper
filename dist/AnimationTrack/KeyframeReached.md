Fires every time playback of an [AnimationTrack](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/AnimationTrack) reaches a [Keyframe](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Keyframe) that does not have the default name - “Keyframe”.

This event allows a developer to run code at predefined points in an animation (set by [Keyframe](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Keyframe) names). This allows the default functionality of Roblox animations to be expanded upon by adding [Sound](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Sound)s or `ParticleEffect`s at different points in an animation.

[Keyframe](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Keyframe) names do not need to be unique. For example, if an Animation has three keyframes named “Particles” the KeyframeReached event will fire each time one of these keyframes is reached.

[Keyframe](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Keyframe) names can be set in the Roblox Animation Editor when creating or editing an animation. They cannot however be set by a [Script](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Script) on an existing animation prior to playing it.
