This property sets whether the animation will repeat after finishing. If it is changed while playing the result will take effect after the animation finishes.

The Looped property for [AnimationTrack](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/AnimationTrack) defaults to how it was set in the animation editor. However this property can be changed, allowing control over the [AnimationTrack](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/AnimationTrack) while the game is running. Looped also correctly handles animations played in reverse (negative [AnimationTrack.Speed](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/AnimationTrack/Speed)). After the first keyframe is reached, it will restart at the last keyframe.

This property allows the developer to have a looping and non looping variant of the same animation, without needing to upload two versions to Roblox.
