Fires whenever the [`AnimationTrack`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AnimationTrack) finishes playing.

This event has a number of uses. It can be used to wait until an
[`AnimationTrack`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AnimationTrack) has stopped before continuing (for example, if
chaining a series of animations to play after each other). It can also be
used to clean up any [`Instance`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance)s created during the animation
playback.
