A read only property that returns the length (in seconds) of an
[AnimationTrack](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AnimationTrack). This will return 0 until the animation has fully loaded
and thus may not be immediately available.

When the [AnimationTrack.Speed](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AnimationTrack#Speed) of an [AnimationTrack](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AnimationTrack) is equal to 1, the
animation will take [AnimationTrack.Length](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AnimationTrack#Length) (in seconds) to complete.
