Fires when the [`AnimationTrack`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AnimationTrack) is completely done moving anything
in the world. The animation has finished playing, the "fade out" is
finished, and the subject is in a neutral pose.

You can use this to take action when the animation track's subject is back
in a neutral pose that's unaffected by the [`AnimationTrack`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AnimationTrack) or to
clean up the [`AnimationTrack`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AnimationTrack). or any associated Connections.
