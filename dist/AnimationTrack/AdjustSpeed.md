This function changes the [AnimationTrack.Speed](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/AnimationTrack/Speed) of an animation. A positive value for speed plays the animation forward, a negative one plays it backwards, and 0 pauses it.

An AnimationTrack's initial speed is set as a parameter in [AnimationTrack:Play](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/AnimationTrack/Play). However a track's Speed can be changed during playback, using AdjustSpeed. When speed is equal to 1, the amount of time an animation takes to complete is equal to [AnimationTrack.Length](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/AnimationTrack/Length) (in seconds).

When is adjusted, then the actual time it will take a track to play can be computed by dividing the length by the speed. Speed is a unitless quantity.

Speed can be used to link the length of an animation to different gameplay events (for example recharging an ability) without having to upload different variants of the same animation.
