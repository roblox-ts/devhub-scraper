Stops the [AnimationTrack](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/AnimationTrack). Once called playback of the [AnimationTrack](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/AnimationTrack) will stop and the weight of the animation will move towards zero over a length of time specified by the optional fadeTime parameter.

For example, if Stop is called with a fadeTime of 2 seconds it will take two seconds for the weight of the [AnimationTrack](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/AnimationTrack) to reach zero and its effects completely end. Please note this will be the case regardless of the initial weight of the animation.

It is not recommended to use a fadeTime of 0 seconds to try to override this effect and end the animation immediately as presently, this causes the [AnimationTrack](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/AnimationTrack) poses to freeze.
