The Heat property determines how fast particles are emit from the [Fire](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Fire) object. It is limited to the range \[-25, 25\]. Positive values are in the top (+Y) direction of the parent [BasePart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BasePart) or [Attachment](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Attachment). It also affects the [ParticleEmitter.Acceleration](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/ParticleEmitter/Acceleration) of the inner particles. Below, you can see the effects of higher heat on the velocity/acceleration of the flame particles (left has Heat = 9, right has Heat = 18).
