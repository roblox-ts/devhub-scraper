The Heat property determines how fast particles are emit from the [Fire](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Fire)
object. It is limited to the range [-25, 25]. Positive values are in the
top (+Y) direction of the parent [BasePart](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart) or [Attachment](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Attachment). It also
affects the [ParticleEmitter.Acceleration](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ParticleEmitter#Acceleration) of the inner particles. Below,
you can see the effects of higher heat on the velocity/acceleration of the
flame particles (left has Heat = 9, right has Heat = 18).

![Two torches - the left has Heat = 9 and the right has Heat = 18][1]
