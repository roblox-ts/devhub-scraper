A **HingeConstraint** allows two [Attachments](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Attachment) to rotate about one axis, constraining the two [Attachments](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Attachment) so that they both occupy the same position and that their **X** axes point in the same direction.

Hinges can also be configured to actuate rotation, as follows:

*   If [HingeConstraint.ActuatorType](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/HingeConstraint/ActuatorType) is set to [Motor](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/enum/ActuatorType), the hinge will attempt to rotate the attachments with the goal of reaching [HingeConstraint.AngularVelocity](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/HingeConstraint/AngularVelocity). This rotation is limited by both [HingeConstraint.MotorMaxAcceleration](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/HingeConstraint/MotorMaxAcceleration) and [HingeConstraint.MotorMaxTorque](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/HingeConstraint/MotorMaxTorque).
*   If [HingeConstraint.ActuatorType](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/HingeConstraint/ActuatorType) is set to [Servo](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/enum/ActuatorType), the hinge will attempt to rotate to an angle specified by [HingeConstraint.TargetAngle](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/HingeConstraint/TargetAngle). This rotation is limited by both [HingeConstraint.AngularSpeed](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/HingeConstraint/AngularSpeed) and [HingeConstraint.ServoMaxTorque](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/HingeConstraint/ServoMaxTorque).

Note that both actuated and free spinning rotation can be limited by setting [HingeConstraint.LimitsEnabled](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/HingeConstraint/LimitsEnabled) to `true`. Also note that if this constraint attaches one part (**A**) to another part (**B**) that is anchored or connected to an anchored part (**Z**), part **A** will not be locally simulated when interacting with a player.
