This property specifies the sharpness of the servo motor in reaching the
[`TargetAngle`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HingeConstraint#TargetAngle), when
[`ActuatorType`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HingeConstraint#ActuatorType) is set to
[`Servo`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/ActuatorType). Larger values correspond to a faster response
and smaller values results in more damping and a slower response.
