This property specifies the sharpness of the servo motor in reaching the
[HingeConstraint.TargetAngle](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HingeConstraint#TargetAngle), when [HingeConstraint.ActuatorType](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HingeConstraint#ActuatorType) is set
to **Servo**. Larger values correspond to a faster response and smaller
values results in more damping and a slower response.
