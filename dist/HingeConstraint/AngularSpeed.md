The desired angular speed a [HingeConstraint](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HingeConstraint) with
[HingeConstraint.ActuatorType](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HingeConstraint#ActuatorType) set to [Servo](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/enum/ActuatorType) will
attempt to maintain while rotating towards its
[HingeConstraint.TargetAngle](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HingeConstraint#TargetAngle). Measured in radians/second.
