The desired angular speed a [`HingeConstraint`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HingeConstraint) with
[`ActuatorType`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HingeConstraint#ActuatorType) set to
`Enum.ActuatorType|Servo` will attempt to maintain while rotating towards
its [`TargetAngle`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HingeConstraint#TargetAngle). Measured in
radians/second.
