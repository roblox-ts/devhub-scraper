The maximum angular acceleration a [`HingeConstraint`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HingeConstraint) with
[`ActuatorType`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HingeConstraint#ActuatorType) set to
[`Motor`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/ActuatorType) can apply to achieve its
[`AngularVelocity`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HingeConstraint#AngularVelocity). Measured in
radians/secondÂ².
