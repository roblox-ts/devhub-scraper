Calling this method transforms the TerrainRegion into a
[`TerrainRegion`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TerrainRegion) usable for [`Terrain`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Terrain). This can only be done
from a plugin, when in edit mode.

The game can't be running, nor can it have a [`NetworkServer`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/NetworkServer).
