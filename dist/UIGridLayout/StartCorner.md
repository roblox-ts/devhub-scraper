StartCorner ([StartCorner](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/enum/StartCorner)) determines from which corner the grid starts laying out UI elements. The grid continues in the [UIGridStyleLayout.FillDirection](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/UIGridStyleLayout/FillDirection), filling elements one by one until `UIGridLayout/FIllDirectionMaxCells` cells have been laid out in that row/column or if all the parent UI element's space has been occupied by previous cells.
