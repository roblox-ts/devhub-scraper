FillDirectionMaxCells determines the number of cells in the grid that can
be used before continuing on the next row/column (whether this is a row or
column is dependent on [`UIGridStyleLayout.FillDirection`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UIGridStyleLayout#FillDirection)). This
value must be non-negative.

- If set to zero, there is no maximum number of cells that may appear in
one row/column except for how many can fit within the parent UI element.
- If set to one, this creates a list similar to those created by
[`UIListLayout`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UIListLayout).
