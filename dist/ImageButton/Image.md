The Image property is a content-type property that should hold the asset
ID of a Decal or Image on the Roblox website. It functions identically to
[`Decal.Texture`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Decal#Texture) with regards to loading the image from the Roblox
website. The rendered image will be colorized using
[`ImageButton.ImageColor3`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ImageButton#ImageColor3). It is possible to make the image render
as tiled, scaled to fit, or 9-sliced, by adjusting the
[`ImageButton.ScaleType`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ImageButton#ScaleType) property.
