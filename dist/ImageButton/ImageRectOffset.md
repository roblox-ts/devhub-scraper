Allows the partial display of an image in conjunction with
[ImageButton.ImageRectSize](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ImageButton#ImageRectSize). This property determines the pixel offset
(from the top-left) of the image area to be displayed.

This property behaves identically to [ImageLabel.ImageRectSize](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ImageLabel#ImageRectSize).
