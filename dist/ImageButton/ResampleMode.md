Determines how the image looks when it is scaled.

By default, the image smooths out the texture when displayed either larger
or smaller than its size in texture memory. In contrast,
[`Enum.ResamplerMode.Pixelated`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/ResamplerMode) preserves the
sharp edges of the image pixels.
