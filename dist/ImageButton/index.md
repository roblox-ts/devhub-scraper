An ImageButton behaves similarly to an [ImageLabel](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ImageLabel) in regards to rendering with the additional behaviors of a [GuiButton](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/GuiButton). It defines the same image-rendering properties as a [ImageLabel](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ImageLabel) does.

You can disable image rendering by setting [ImageButton.ImageTransparency](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/ImageButton/ImageTransparency) to 1. This will leave you with a plain rectangle that can be used as a button. However, it may be better to use a blank [TextButton](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/TextButton) for this.
