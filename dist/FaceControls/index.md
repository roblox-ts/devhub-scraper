The [FaceControls](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/FaceControls) object defines a set of properties for controlling the
facial expressions of a Dynamic Head.

The FaceControls properties are based on the Facial Action Coding System
(FACS), a comprehensive system for describing all visually discernible facial
movement based on anatomy. [FaceControls](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/FaceControls) properties can only be set between 0
and 1. Different combinations of the [FaceControls](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/FaceControls) property values create
different facial expressions. Recording multiple facial expressions over time
creates facial animation.

## What is a Dynamic Head?

A Dynamic Head is a [MeshPart](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/MeshPart) that implements a facial rig and is capable of
playing facial animations and triggering facial expressions. A [FaceControls](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/FaceControls)
object that is a child of a Dynamic Head [MeshPart](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/MeshPart) can change the facial
expressions of the Dynamic Head.

A dynamic head consists of the following three components:

- Skinned MeshPart instance for the head geometry with an internal rig that
  deforms this skinned MeshPart
- FaceControls instance that drives the internal rig when properties such as
  FaceControls.JawDrop are changed.
- Cage [WrapTarget](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/WrapTarget) instance for tight fitting facial accessories

In a third-party modeling tool, such as Blender or Maya, an artist can create
a joint-driven facial rig, pose the joints to match each of the individual
FACS controls, and save as an FBX. When a Dynamic Head `.FBX` is imported in
Studio, a facs-to-joint mapping is created. This mapping deforms the mesh
geometry when FaceControls properties are changed. The mapping and the facial
rig (including [Bone](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Bone) instances) are not exposed to developers and can only be
accessed through the FaceControls instance. The [MeshPart](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/MeshPart) for a Dynamic Head
looks and behaves the same as a regular [MeshPart](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/MeshPart) except when a FaceControls
instance is a child of the MeshPart. Editing the properties of the
FaceControls deforms the MeshPartâ€™s geometry. These properties are available
to animate in the Animation Editor.
