An IntValue is an object that stores a single signed 64-bit integer. Integers do not include decimal points. The highest value that can be stored is 2^63-1, or around 9.2 quintillion. Attempting to store numbers larger than this may cause [integer overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow). The lowest value that can be stored is -2^63, or about negative 9.2 quintillion. For values outside of this range, use a NumberValue instead. Like all “-Value” objects, this single value is stored in the Value property. The [IntValue.Changed](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/IntValue/Changed) event for this (and other objects like it) will run with the new value being stored in the object, instead of a string representing the property being changed.
