The Shape property sets the shape of the pemitter to either a box, sphere,
cylinder, or disc. After you make a selection, you can adjust the
[`ParticleEmitter.ShapeStyle`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ParticleEmitter#ShapeStyle), [`ParticleEmitter.ShapeInOut`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ParticleEmitter#ShapeInOut),
and [`ParticleEmitter.ShapePartial`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ParticleEmitter#ShapePartial) properties to further customize
particle emission. For visual examples, see
[Particle Emitters - Shapes](https://create.roblox.com/docs/effects/particle-emitters#shape).
