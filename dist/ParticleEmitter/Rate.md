The Rate property determines how many particles are [ParticleEmitter:Emit](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/ParticleEmitter/Emit) emit per second while the [ParticleEmitter](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ParticleEmitter) is [ParticleEmitter.Enabled](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/ParticleEmitter/Enabled). It is the inverse of frequency - a Rate of 5 means that a particle will be emit every `1/5 = 0.2` seconds. When changed, this property will have no affect on any already emit particles.

it is important to pick a sensible [ParticleEmitter.Lifetime](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/ParticleEmitter/Lifetime) and Rate so that you don't have too many particles being rendered at once. Long lifetimes and high emission rates are a quick way to cause performance issues. If you need many particles, pick a balance of lifetime and rate. To instantly remove any presently emit particles (perhaps ones with absurdly long lifetimes), you can call [ParticleEmitter:Clear](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/ParticleEmitter/Clear).
