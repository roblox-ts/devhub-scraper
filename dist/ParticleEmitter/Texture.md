The Texture property determines the image rendered on particle billboards.
The rendered image is influenced by [`ParticleEmitter.Color`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ParticleEmitter#Color),
[`ParticleEmitter.Transparency`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ParticleEmitter#Transparency),
[`ParticleEmitter.LightInfluence`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ParticleEmitter#LightInfluence), and
[`ParticleEmitter.LightEmission`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ParticleEmitter#LightEmission). Transparent textures work best for
particles
