A ParticleEmitter allows for the creation of [particle systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_system). is a special effect object that emits customizable 2D billboard particles into the world. On Roblox, a particle is a 2D image rendered in the world so that it always always face the camera, much like a [BillboardGui](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BillboardGui) with a single [ImageLabel](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ImageLabel) in it.

ParticleEmitter must be parented to a [BasePart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BasePart) (such as a [Part](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Part)) or an [Attachment](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Attachment) within such a part. Particles spawn randomly in the **bounding box** of its parent part (for attachments, this is a single point). Particles from a single emitter will render so long as this condition is met; setting a ParticleEmitter's [Instance.Parent](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Instance/Parent) to nil will remove all particles instantly, like how [ParticleEmitter:Clear](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/ParticleEmitter/Clear) works. If an emitter is [ParticleEmitter.Enabled](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/ParticleEmitter/Enabled) and has a nonzero [ParticleEmitter.Rate](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/ParticleEmitter/Rate), it will emit particles on its own. Finer control on the number of particles can be accomplished using [ParticleEmitter:Emit](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/ParticleEmitter/Emit).

Roblox provides several pre-made particle effect objects - [Fire](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Fire), [Smoke](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Smoke) and [Sparkles](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Sparkles). They behave similarly to a ParticleEmitter, but they are not as customizable. They also lack certain particle-controlling methods: [ParticleEmitter:Emit](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/ParticleEmitter/Emit) and [ParticleEmitter:Clear](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/ParticleEmitter/Clear). An [Explosion](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Explosion) also uses particles, but provides little-to-no control with regards to how the effect looks.
