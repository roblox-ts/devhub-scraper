The LightEmission property determines the blending of the
[ParticleEmitter.Texture](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ParticleEmitter#Texture)'s colors with the colors behind them. It should
be set on the range [0, 1]. A value of 0 uses normal blending modes, and a
value of 1 will use additive blending. The value of the additive blending
is determined by this property. When changed, this property instantly
affects all particles owned by the emitter, both current and future
particles.

Pictured below are two default ParticleEmitters. The right one has its
LightEmission set to 1, so the particles appear brighter due to the
additive blending when they overlap.

When set to 1, only additive blending is used. As such, choosing a
suitable [ParticleEmitter.Texture](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ParticleEmitter#Texture) is necessary. Below is an example
texture that is suitable for such a ParticleEmitter.

This property should not be confused with
[ParticleEmitter.LightInfluence](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ParticleEmitter#LightInfluence), which determines how particles are
affected by environment light. This property does not cause particles to
light the environment around them. To do that, consider using a
[PointLight](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PointLight).
