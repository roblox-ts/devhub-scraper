The Rotation property determines the angle at which new particles are emit. It is a [NumberRange](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/datatype/NumberRange) measured in degrees. Positive values are in the clockwise direction. This property is often set to \[0, 360\] to provide a completely random rotation to new particles. [ParticleEmitter.RotSpeed](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/ParticleEmitter/RotSpeed) also influences the rotation of a particle over its lifetime. Finally, this property is useful for correcting any [ParticleEmitter.Texture](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/ParticleEmitter/Texture)s that aren't at the desired orientation.

Pictured below are two default ParticleEmitters, except that the right has a Rotation of 22.5. Note how the particles on the left are straight up, and the right are tilted slightly.

Changes to this value only affect new particles; existing particles will maintain the rotation at which they were originally emitted.
