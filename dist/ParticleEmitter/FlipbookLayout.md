The [`FlipbookLayout`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ParticleEmitter#FlipbookLayout) property
determines the layout of the texture. It can be any value of the
`Enum.ParticleFlipbookLayout` enum:

- **None** – Disable flipbook features and use the texture as a
single static texture over the particle's lifetime.
- **Grid2x2** – 2×2 frames for a 4-frame animation.
- **Grid4x4** – 4×4 frames for a 16-frame animation.
- **Grid8x8** – 8×8 frames for a 64-frame animation.
