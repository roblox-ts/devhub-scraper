This property determines which orientation mode to use for an emitter's
particle geometry:

FaceCamera: standard camera facing billboard quad, default behavior.
FaceCameraWorldUp: face the camera, but rotating only on the vertical
world-up Y-axis. VelocityParallel: align particles parallel to the
direction of their movement. VelocityPerpendicular: align particles
perpendicular to the direction of their movement.
