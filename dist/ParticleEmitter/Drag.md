The Drag property determines the rate in seconds at which individual
particles will lose half their speed via exponential decay. Pictured below
are two identical default ParticleEmitters, except that the right has a
Drag value of 0.25.

Drag is applied by scaling the expected velocity (from
[ParticleEmitter.Speed](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ParticleEmitter#Speed) and any velocity inherited from the parent from
[ParticleEmitter.VelocityInheritance](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ParticleEmitter#VelocityInheritance)) by the following formula:
`2 ^ (elapsedTime * -drag)`, where `elapsedTime` is the time since the
particle was emit. Consequently, setting Drag to a negative value will
cause particles' velocities to grow exponentially.

Warning: if Drag is set to a sufficiently negative value, this can cause
all particles emit by the emitter to completely disappear. Be careful when
setting this property lower than -100.
