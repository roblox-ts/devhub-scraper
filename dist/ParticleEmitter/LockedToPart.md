The LockedToPart property determines if particles will “stick” to the emission source (the [Attachment](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Attachment) or [BasePart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BasePart) to which the [ParticleEmitter](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ParticleEmitter) is parented).

Below is an animation of two [Parts](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Part) being moved simultaneously in Studio. Inside each is a default [ParticleEmitter](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ParticleEmitter); the background/left emitter has LockedToPart enabled so the column of particles moves as the part is moved. Contrast with the foreground/right emitter particles which stay in their world position.

Also consider using the [ParticleEmitter.VelocityInheritance](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/ParticleEmitter/VelocityInheritance) property set to 1, which may be more appropriate for some effects.
