The ZOffset property determines the forward-backward (Z) render position
of particles, in studs. they render at a modified [ParticleEmitter.Size](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ParticleEmitter#Size)
such that this property will not affect the screen size of particles. When
changed, this property will affects all particles, both current and future
particles. Note that this property accepts fractional values; it is not
like [GuiObject.ZIndex](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiObject#ZIndex) (an integer)

Pictured below are three default ParticleEmitters with varying ZOffset
values. The center is default, the left has +2 and the right has -2. Note
how all the particles have the same apparent screen size.

A practical use of ZOffset is for `ParticleEmitters` placed in players'
characters: use it to define if particles should appear in front of or
behind the character (use a value of +/- 2).

Positive values will move particles closer to the camera, and negative
values move particles away. Sufficiently negative values can cause
particles to render inside or behind the parent part.
