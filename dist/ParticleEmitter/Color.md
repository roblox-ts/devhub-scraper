The Color property determines the color of all particles active in an emitter's system. The color is applied to the [ParticleEmitter.Texture](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/ParticleEmitter/Texture) when rendering, and uses the texture alpha along with the [ParticleEmitter.Transparency](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/ParticleEmitter/Transparency). If a particle has a [ParticleEmitter.LightEmission](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/ParticleEmitter/LightEmission) of greater than 0, darker colors will make particles appear more transparent. Below, two default [ParticleEmitter](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ParticleEmitter) are pictured, except the right emitter uses a Color from yellow to cyan.

Note that the default [ParticleEmitter.Lifetime](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/ParticleEmitter/Lifetime) is 5 to 10 seconds, so some particles next to each other have small variations in color due to the variations in individual particle lifetime.

A particle's present color is determined by linearly interpolating on this ColorSequence using the particle's age and the particle's total lifetime. For example, if a particle spawned 2 seconds ago and has a 4 second lifetime, the color will be whatever is 50% of the way through the [ColorSequence](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/datatype/ColorSequence).

Changing this property applies changes to all particles present in the system. This is because the color of a particle is determined using its present lifetime and this ColorSequence (the ColorSequence when the particle was emit is not stored on a per-particle basis).
