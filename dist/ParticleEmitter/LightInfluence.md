The LightInfluence property determines how much environment light affects
the color of individual particles when they are rendered. It must be in
the range [0, 1]; behavior of values outside of this range are not
defined. At 0, particles are not influenced by light at all (they retain
full brightness), and at 1 particles are fully influenced by light (in
complete darkness, particles will be black).

Pictured below are three default ParticleEmitters [at night][1] with
varing LightInfluence. There is a [PointLight](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PointLight) with sufficient
[PointLight.Brightness](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PointLight#Brightness) and [PointLight.Range](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PointLight#Range) to light the particles near
to their parent parts. Take note of how each particle is affected by the
lack of light close to the end of their lifetime.

By default, this value is 1 if inserted with Studio tools. If inserted
using `Instance.new`, it is 0.
