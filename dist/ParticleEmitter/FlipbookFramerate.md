The [`FlipbookFramerate`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ParticleEmitter#FlipbookFramerate) property
determines how fast the flipbook texture animates in frames per second.
Like [`Lifetime`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ParticleEmitter#Lifetime), you can set a minimum and
maximum range to randomize the framerate of the flip book, with a maximum
of 30 frames per second.
