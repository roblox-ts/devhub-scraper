An equalizer allows for control of the volume of various frequency ranges for
the [`Sound`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Sound) or [`SoundGroup`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SoundGroup) the effect is parented to. This can be
used to highlight particular elements of audio or minimize or outright
eliminate others. The [`EqualizerSoundEffect`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/EqualizerSoundEffect) gives control over three
ranges of frequency: Low, Mid, and High. Their specific frequencies are as
follows:

- Low: 0 - 400 Hz
- Mid: 400 - 4000 Hz
- High: 4000+ Hz
