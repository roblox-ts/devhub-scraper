A simple container used to hold and organize Roblox instances. Unlike other
container classes like [`Model`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Model), a folder offers no additional
functionality. Folders behave the same way as folders in a computer file
system, meaning they can also be parented to each other.
