A BindableFunction is a Roblox object that allows you to give access to functions to external scripts. Functions put in BindableFunctions will not be replicated, therefore making it impossible to use these objects to pass functions between scripts. Functions are invoked through [BindableFunction:Invoke](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/BindableFunction/Invoke), which calls [BindableFunction.OnInvoke](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BindableFunction/OnInvoke).
