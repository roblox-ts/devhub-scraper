The Accessory class is an extension to the [Hat](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Hat) class, and is also the successor to the legacy Hat system.  
It's designed to be cross-compatible with both the legacy R6 character system, and the new R15 character system.  
  
If an [Attachment](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Attachment) is inserted into the Accessory's Handle with the same name as an [Attachment](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Attachment) found in one of the character's limbs, they will connect, and the properties inherited from the [Accoutrement](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Accoutrement) class will be ignored. Otherwise, the Accessory functions identically to a [Hat](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Hat).  
  
Note: If two matching [Attachment](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Attachment) are found the resulting [Weld](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Weld) will be a child of the Handle of the Accessory. This differs from the legacy behavior of Hats where the Weld is always a child of the Head of the character.
