InstanceCount is a read-only measurement of how many [Instance](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Instance) are currently in memory.  
  
This includes the [DataModel](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/DataModel), its descendants, as well as any object created with `Instance.new` which is still present in memory.
