InstanceCount is a read-only measurement of how many [Instance](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance) are
currently in memory. This includes the [DataModel](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DataModel), its descendants, as
well as any object created with `Instance.new` which is still present in
memory.
