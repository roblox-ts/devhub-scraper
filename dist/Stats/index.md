Stats is a service that provides real-time performance information about the
current running game instance. Its primary purpose is to provide developers
with an end point to measure where resources are being consumed, as well as
how much memory is being consumed overall.

The service also stores a tree of [`StatsItem`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/StatsItem), which can have their
values read by plugins.
