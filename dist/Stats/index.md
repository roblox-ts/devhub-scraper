Stats is a service that provides real-time performance information about the current running game instance. Its primary purpose is to provide developers with an end point to measure where resources are being consumed, as well as how much memory is being consumed overall.  
  
The service also stores a tree of [StatsItem](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/StatsItem), which can have their values read by plugins.
