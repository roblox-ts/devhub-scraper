The Size property of [Smoke](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Smoke) determines the size of the newly emit smoke particles. Unlike [Smoke.Color](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Smoke/Color), this property will not change the size of existing particles. It must be in the range \[0.1, 100\]. Unlike [ParticleEmitter.Size](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/ParticleEmitter/Size), this property is only a number (not a [NumberSequence](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/datatype/NumberSequence)). Also note also that the size of the particles is not 1-to-1 with studs; in fact, the size of the smoke particle is more than twice as large. At the largest size, smoke particles can render larger than 200 studs wide!
