RiseVelocity behaves similarly to [ParticleEmitter.Speed](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/ParticleEmitter/Speed) and [Fire.Heat](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Fire/Heat): it determines how fast the smoke particles move during their lifetime. It must be in the range \[-25, 25\]. Negative values will cause particles to emit in the bottom (-Y) direction of the parent [BasePart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BasePart).

When using a [Smoke](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Smoke) effect to create fog, set this property to 0. For large smoke effects, make the rise subtle (2 to 8). For chimneys and smokestacks, higher values are appropriate.
