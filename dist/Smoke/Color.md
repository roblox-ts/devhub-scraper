The Color property determines the color of all the particles emit by a
[`Smoke`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Smoke) object (both existing and future particles). It behaves
similarly to [`ParticleEmitter.Color`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ParticleEmitter#Color), except that it is only one
color and not a [`ColorSequence`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/datatypes/ColorSequence). A color of white with some
[`Smoke.Opacity`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Smoke#Opacity) makes for a nice fog effect, and a very opaque black
color can compliment a [`Fire`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Fire) object nicely.
