The Rotate object is used to allow rotation between two parts. Most commonly
created through the Hinge SurfaceType on a [`BasePart`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart). If created like
this, the rotation will be about the normal vector from the face of the part
the hinge is placed on. If created through a script the axis and point of
rotation can be defined arbitrarily.
