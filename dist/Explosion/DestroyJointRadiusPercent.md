Used to set the proportion of the [Explosion.BlastRadius](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Explosion/BlastRadius), between 0 and 1, within which all joints will be destroyed. Anything outside of this range will only have the [Explosion](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Explosion) force applied to it.

For example, if [Explosion.BlastRadius](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Explosion/BlastRadius) is set to 100 and DestroyJointRadiusPercent is set to 0.5, any joints within a radius of 50 studs would be broken. Any joints between the ranges of 50 and 100 studs wouldn't be destroyed, but the [Explosion](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Explosion)'s force would still be applied to the [BasePart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BasePart)s.

This property allows developers to make [Explosion](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Explosion)s 'non-lethal' to [Humanoid](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Humanoid)s by setting DestroyJointRadiusPercent to 0. This means the neck joint will not be broken when characters come into contact with the [Explosion](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Explosion).
