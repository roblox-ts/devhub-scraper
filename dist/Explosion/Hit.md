Fires when the [Explosion](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Explosion) hits a [BasePart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BasePart) within its [Explosion.BlastRadius](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Explosion/BlastRadius). Returns the part hit along with the distance of the part from [Explosion.Position](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Explosion/Position).

Note that the effect of an [Explosion](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Explosion) is not disrupted by obstacles, this means parts shielded behind other parts will still be hit, even if the [BasePart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BasePart) they are shielded behind is anchored.

This event will also fire when [Explosion.BlastPressure](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Explosion/BlastPressure) is equal to zero. This means developers can program their own custom behavior for explosions by eliminating the explosion's influence on [BasePart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BasePart)s and [Terrain](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Terrain).

Note that this event will fire for every [BasePart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BasePart) hit. This means it can fire multiple times for the same player character (as the character [Model](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Model) is made up of multiple parts). For this reason when dealing custom damage using the `Explosion.Hit` event it's recommended to implement a check to see if the character has already been hit by the [Explosion](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Explosion).
