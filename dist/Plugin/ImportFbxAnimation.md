This function prompts the user to open a .fbx animation file that can be
loaded onto the `rigModel`, then proceeds to insert the animation as a
[`KeyframeSequence`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/KeyframeSequence) in the [`Workspace`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Workspace).
