Plugin is the main object responsible for creating basic studio widgets. It is a custom add-on to Studio which adds new behavior and features that are not normally included.

Both the `articles/using animation editor|Animation Editor` and `articles/Intro To Terrain|Terrain Tools` were originally developed as plugins. There are also many plugins made by the Roblox community that you can use to help make games and experiences.
