Plugin is the main object responsible for creating basic studio widgets. It is
a custom add-on to Studio which adds new behavior and features that are not
normally included.

Both the [Animation Editor](/building-and-visuals/animation/animation-editor)
and [Terrain Editor](/studio/terrain-editor) were originally developed as
plugins. There are also many plugins made by the Roblox community that you can
use to help make games and experiences.
