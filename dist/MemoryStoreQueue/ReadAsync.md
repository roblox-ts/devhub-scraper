Reads one or more items from the queue as a single atomic operation.

This method does not automatically delete the returned items from the queue but makes them invisible to other ReadAsync calls for the period of the invisibility timeout. The items must be explicitly removed from the queue with [MemoryStoreQueue:RemoveAsync](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/MemoryStoreQueue/RemoveAsync) before the invisibility timeout expires. The invisibility timeout defaults to 30 seconds unless a different value was provided in [MemoryStoreService:GetQueue](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/MemoryStoreService/GetQueue).
