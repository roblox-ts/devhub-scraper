Provides access to a queue within MemoryStore. A queue is a data structure that provides temporary storage for arbitrary items (up to the maximum item size â€“ see `articles/Memory Store|MemoryStore Limits`). Each queue item has a numeric priority: MemoryStore retrieves items with higher priority from the queue first, and it retrieves Items with the same priority in order of addition.

Items in the queue can optionally be set to expire after a certain amount of time. Expired items simply disappear from the queue as if they were never added.
