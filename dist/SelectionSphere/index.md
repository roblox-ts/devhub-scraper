**SelectionSphere** is an object which renders a 3D sphere around its [Adornee](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/PVAdornment/Adornee) when it is a descendant of the [Workspace](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Workspace) or anywhere where GUI objects are rendered. The sphere's geometry consists of a ring/outline in addition to a surface. By default, only the outline is visible.

![A default SelectionSphere adorned to a semi-transparent default Part](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/bltb3e8cdfab0891947/SelectionSphere.jpg) There are a few properties available to configure the appearance of the sphere. The outline can modified through the [Color3](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/GuiBase3d/Color3)† and [Transparency](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/GuiBase3d/Transparency)† properties. The surface can be modified through the [SurfaceColor3](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/SelectionSphere/SurfaceColor3) and [SurfaceTransparency](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/SelectionSphere/SurfaceTransparency) properties. Finally, rendering of the sphere can be toggled with the [Visible](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/GuiBase3d/Visible)† property.

† These properties come from this object's superclass, [GuiBase3d](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/GuiBase3d).

The SelectionSphere object does not capture any form of input; it is solely a visual effect. To capture simple pointer input on the adornee, consider using a [ClickDetector](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ClickDetector).
