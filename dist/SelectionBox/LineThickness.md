**LineThickness** determines the thickness of the box's outlines. It is
measured in studs, the same unit for [`BasePart.Size`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#Size). If set to 0,
the outline will not be visible at all.

Pictured above are three default [`Part`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Part)s with default SelectionBoxes
applied to them. Their thicknesses from left-to-right are 0.075, 0.15
(default) and 0.3.
