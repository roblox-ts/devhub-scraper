A SelectionBox is an object which is used to put a 3D box around the part it's adorned to.

SelectionBoxes require a parent, like all objects and an [Adornee](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/PVAdornment/Adornee). You can place the SelectionBox wherever you want as its parent, but you must set its adornee. An adornee what it shows up on, so basically it makes it overlay onto the part.
