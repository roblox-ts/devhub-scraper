**SurfaceColor3** determines the color of the SelectionBox's surfaces.

See also:

- [`SurfaceTransparency`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SelectionBox#SurfaceTransparency), which
controls the transparency of the surfaces. You may need to adjust this
property in order to see changes to SurfaceColor.
- [`GuiBase3d.Color`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiBase3d#Color), a property of the superclass [`GuiBase3d`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiBase3d)
which controls the color of the outline rather than the surface faces
