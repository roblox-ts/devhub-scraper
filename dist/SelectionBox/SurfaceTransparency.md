**SurfaceTransparency** determines the transparency of the SelectionBox's
surfaces, similar to the way [`BasePart.Transparency`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#Transparency) works. By
default, this property is 1, which causes the surfaces to not be visible.

- [`SurfaceColor3`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SelectionBox#SurfaceColor3), which controls the
color of the surface.
- [`GuiBase3d.Transparency`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiBase3d#Transparency), a property of the superclass
[`GuiBase3d`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiBase3d) which controls the transparency of the outline rather
than the surface faces
