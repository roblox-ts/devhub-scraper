The maximum angular speed used to align the
[`ControllerManager.RootPart`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ControllerManager#RootPart) upright and aligned to the
[`ControllerManager.ClimbSensor`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ControllerManager#ClimbSensor). A lower value means it
takes longer for the root part to recover to the align position when
misaligned. A higher value results in a quicker recovery.
