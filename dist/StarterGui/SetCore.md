SetCore (not to be confused with [SetCoreGuiEnabled](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/StarterGui/SetCoreGuiEnabled)) exposes a variety of functionality defined by Roblox's [CoreScripts](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/CoreScript), such as sending notifications, toggling notifications for badges/points, defining a callback for the reset button or toggling the topbar. The first parameter to SetCore is a string that selects the functionality with which the call will interact: a CoreScript must have registered such a string already (if one hasn't, an error is raised). It may be necessary to make multiple calls to SetCore using `pcall` in case the respective CoreScript has yet to load (or if it has been disabled entirely).

The following table describes the strings that may be accepted as the first parameter in a call to SetCore. The parameters that should follow are dependent on the functionality that will be used and are described in sub-tables.

end

	"FocusChatBar", -- Fired when the CoreGui wants to capture the Chatbar's Focus.
	"TopbarEnabledChanged", -- Fired when the visibility of the Topbar is changed.
