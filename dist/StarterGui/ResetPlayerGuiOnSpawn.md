If set to true, each child parented to the [`StarterGui`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/StarterGui) will be
cloned into a player's [`PlayerGui`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PlayerGui) when that player's character is
respawned.

If one of the children is a PlayerGui and it has its PlayerGui property
set to false, it will not be cloned.
