If set to true, each child parented to the [StarterGui](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/StarterGui) will be cloned into a player's [PlayerGui](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/PlayerGui) when that player's character is respawned.

If one of the children is a PlayerGui and it has its PlayerGui property set to false, it will not be cloned.
