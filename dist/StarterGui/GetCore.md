GetCore returns data set or made available by Roblox's [CoreScripts](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/CoreScript). The first and only parameter is a string that selects the information to be fetched. The following sections describe the strings and the data they return by this function.

Each of these is registered by a CoreScript and calling this function may yield. Many of these also register an equivalent [SetCore](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/StarterGui/SetCore) function (these are marked with an asterisk).
