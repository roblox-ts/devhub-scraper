The WorldModel provides some physics features to a [ViewportFrame](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ViewportFrame).

More specifically, you can make a WorldModel a child of a ViewportFrame, and then parent geometry to the WorldModel. This will then allow you to use [raycasts](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/raycasting) in the ViewportFrame through the WorldModel. Furthermore you can put [Humanoid](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Humanoid) characters in the WorldModel and their joints will be set-up correctly, and you can animate them.
