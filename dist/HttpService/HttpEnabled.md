When set to true, you are able to send requests to other websites using [HttpService:GetAsync](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/HttpService/GetAsync), [HttpService:PostAsync](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/HttpService/PostAsync), and [HttpService:RequestAsync](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/HttpService/RequestAsync).

To enable HTTP requests, the HttpService must be enabled through Studio's Game Settings by opening the game's settings via the **Game Settings** button on the _Home_ tab of the game's studio window (see image below):
