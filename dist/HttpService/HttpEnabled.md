When set to true, you are able to send requests to other websites using
[`HttpService:GetAsync()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HttpService#GetAsync), [`HttpService:PostAsync()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HttpService#PostAsync), and
[`HttpService:RequestAsync()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HttpService#RequestAsync).

To enable HTTP requests, the [`HttpService`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HttpService) must be enabled in
Studio's [Game Settings](https://create.roblox.com/docs/studio/game-settings) through the
**Security** â†’ **Allow HTTP Requests** toggle.
