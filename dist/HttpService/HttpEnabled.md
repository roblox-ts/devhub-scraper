[HttpService:GetAsync](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HttpService#GetAsync), [HttpService:PostAsync](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HttpService#PostAsync), and
[HttpService:RequestAsync](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HttpService#RequestAsync).
