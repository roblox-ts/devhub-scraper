This service allows HTTP requests to be sent from game servers. This enables users to create integration with a wide range of third party services such as analytics and storage. One exciting prospect for this service is that if you run and manage your own website, and communicate with it from Roblox, it opens the possibility of remote server management and real time communication with the server, through your site.

If the limit of 500 http [GET](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/HttpService/GetAsync) / [POST](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/HttpService/PostAsync) requests per minute is exceeded, the Service will stall entirely for approximately 30 seconds.

Enabling HTTP requests
----------------------

HttpService starts off as disabled by default.

To [enable](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/HttpService/HttpEnabled) HTTP requests, the HttpService must be enabled through Studio's Game Settings by opening the game's settings via the `Game Settings` button on the `Home` tab of the game's studio window. Within the Game Settings window, navigate to the `Options` tab and select the _On_ option under `Allow HTTP Requests`.
