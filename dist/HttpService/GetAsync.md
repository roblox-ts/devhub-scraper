The GetAsync function sends an HTTP GET request. It functions similarly to [RequestAsync](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/HttpService/RequestAsync) except that it accepts HTTP request parameters as method parameters instead of a single dictionary and returns only the body of the HTTP response. Generally, this method is useful only as a shorthand and [RequestAsync](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/HttpService/RequestAsync) should to be used in most cases. For a detailed guide on sending and retrieving data via HTTP requests, see the [Sending HTTP Requests](https://developer.roblox.com/articles/Sending-HTTP-requests) article.

When true, the `nocache` parameter prevents this function from caching results from previous calls with the same `url`.
