BodyColors is a utility object used by Roblox to load avatar body colors from the website.  
  
Avatars that are loaded from the website will automatically have a BodyColors object corresponding to said avatar's body color configuration.  
  
When parented inside of a character with a [Humanoid](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Humanoid), it will apply the colors to each specified limb.
