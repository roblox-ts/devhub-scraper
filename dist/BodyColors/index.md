BodyColors is a utility object used by Roblox to load avatar body colors from
the website. Avatars that are loaded from the website will automatically have
a BodyColors object corresponding to said avatar's body color configuration.
When parented inside of a character with a [Humanoid](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid), it will apply the
colors to each specified limb.
