A UIScale object simply contains a number that is used to multiply the
[GuiBase2d.AbsoluteSize](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiBase2d#AbsoluteSize) of the parent UI element. This number is stored in
[UIScale.Scale](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UIScale#Scale).
