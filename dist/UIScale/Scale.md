The Scale property determines the multiplier used on the parent UI element's [GuiBase2d.AbsoluteSize](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/GuiBase2d/AbsoluteSize). When set to 0.5, an AbsoluteSize of {0, 200}, {0, 50} becomes {0, 100}, {0, 25}. Similarly, when set to 2, such an AbsoluteSize would become {0, 400}, {0, 100}.
