The Scale property determines the multiplier used on the parent UI
element's [`GuiBase2d.AbsoluteSize`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiBase2d#AbsoluteSize). When set to 0.5, an AbsoluteSize
of {0, 200}, {0, 50} becomes {0, 100}, {0, 25}. Similarly, when set to 2,
such an AbsoluteSize would become {0, 400}, {0, 100}.
