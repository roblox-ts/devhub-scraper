A **ViewportFrame** is a type of [GUI](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiObject) that can render 3D objects
inside its bounds. This is a great way to display 3D objects/models in a 2D
GUI space like a [ScreenGui](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ScreenGui). At the moment, no shadow or post effects are
available. Neon and Glass [materials](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/enum/Material) will be rendered on lowest
quality.

For a step-by-step walkthrough, see the
