A **ViewportFrame** is a type of [GUI](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/GuiObject) that can render 3D objects inside its bounds. This is a great way to display 3D objects/models in a 2DÂ GUI space like a [ScreenGui](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ScreenGui). At the moment, no shadow or post effects are available. Neon and Glass [materials](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/enum/Material) will be rendered on lowest quality.

For a step-by-step walkthrough, see the [ViewportFrame GUI](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/ViewportFrame-GUI) article.
