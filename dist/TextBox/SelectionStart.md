Determines the starting position of a text selection, or -1 if the TextBox has no range of selected text. If the value is -1 or equivalent to [CursorPosition](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/TextBox/CursorPosition), there is no range of text selected. This property uses the same positioning logic as CursorPosition. SelectionStart will be greater than CursorPosition if the cursor is at the beginning of a selection, and less than CursorPosition if the cursor is at the end.
