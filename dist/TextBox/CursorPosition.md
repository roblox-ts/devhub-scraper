**CursorPosition** determines the offset of the text cursor in bytes, or -1 if the TextBox is not currently being edited. A value of 1 represents the beginning, the position before the first byte in the [Text](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/TextBox/Text) property. When used in conjunction with the [SelectionStart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/TextBox/SelectionStart) property, it is possible to both get and set selected text within a TextBox.

It should be noted that the units of this property is **bytes** and that many unicode characters such as emoji are **longer than 1 byte**. For instance, if a player types into the TextBox ‚ÄúHelloüëã‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúHello‚Äù immediately followed by the waving hand sign ‚Äì the cursor position would be 10, not 7, since the emoji uses 4 bytes.
