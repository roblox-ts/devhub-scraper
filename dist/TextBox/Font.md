The Font property selects one of several pre-defined [fonts](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/enum/Font)
with which the UI element will render its text. Some fonts have bold,
italic and/or light variants (as there is no font-weight or font-style
properties).

With the exception of the "Legacy" font, each font will render text with
the line height equal to the [TextBox.TextSize](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextBox#TextSize) property. The "Code" font
is the only monospace font. It has the unique property that each character
has the exact same width and height ratio of 1:2. The width of each
character is approximately half the [TextBox.TextSize](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextBox#TextSize) property.
