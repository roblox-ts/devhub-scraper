**TextEditable** determines whether the user can change the
[`Text`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextBox#Text) through input. It is recommended to disable
[`ClearTextOnFocus`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextBox#ClearTextOnFocus) when this property is
disabled, otherwise the Text could be cleared on-focus. This property is
useful to make read-only TextBoxes from which content can be copied
in-game.
