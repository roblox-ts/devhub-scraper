**TextEditable** determines whether the user can change the [Text](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/TextBox/Text) through input. It is recommended to disable [ClearTextOnFocus](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/TextBox/ClearTextOnFocus) when this property is disabled, otherwise the Text could be cleared on-focus. This property is useful to make read-only TextBoxes from which content can be copied in-game.
