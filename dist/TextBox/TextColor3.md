This property determines the color of all the text rendered by a [GUI](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/GuiObject) element. This property along with [TextBox.Font](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/TextBox/Font), [TextBox.TextSize](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/TextBox/TextSize) and [TextBox.TextTransparency](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/TextBox/TextTransparency) will determine the visual properties of text. Text is rendered after the text stroke ([TextBox.TextStrokeColor3](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/TextBox/TextStrokeColor3)).

It's important that text is easily read by players! Be sure to choose colors with little-to-no saturation, like white, grey, or black. Make sure the color of your text is contrasted by the `TextBox/BackgroundColor3` of the UI element. If the element has a transparent background, try applying a black [TextBox.TextStrokeColor3](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/TextBox/TextStrokeColor3) to help contrast the text with the 3D world behind it.
