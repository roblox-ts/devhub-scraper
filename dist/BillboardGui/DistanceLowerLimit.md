Determines the distance in studs that a [BillboardGui](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BillboardGui) will stop scaling larger in size at relative to the player's current camera. If the distance of the gui is below this value, it will not be scaled any larger than it would be at this distance. The value of this property defaults to 0 studs.
