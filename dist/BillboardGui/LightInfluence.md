Controls how much the BillboardGui is influenced by the lighting in the
environment.

When set to 0, the UI behaves similarly to an LCD screen, acting as its
own light source and appearing the same regardless of the surrounding
lighting.

When set to 1, the UI behaves similarly to a piece of paper, only
reflecting the light from another source.
