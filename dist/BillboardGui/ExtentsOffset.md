**ExtentsOffset** determines how the BillboardGui is offset from its
[Adornee](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BillboardGui#Adornee), relative to the [Camera](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Camera) orientation and
units are half the dimensions of the model's [Camera](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Camera)-aligned bounding
box.

  works similarly except the offset orientation is relative to the global
  axes

  units are studs
