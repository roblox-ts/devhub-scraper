Determines the distance in studs that a [`BillboardGui`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BillboardGui) will stop
scaling smaller in size at relative to the player's current camera. If the
distance of the gui is above this value, it will not be scaled any smaller
than it would be at this distance.

This property is ignored if the value is less than 0. The default value is
-1, meaning the property is ignored by default.
