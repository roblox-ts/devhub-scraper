**ExtentsOffsetWorldSpace** determines how the BillboardGui is offset from
its [Adornee](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BillboardGui#Adornee), relative to the global axes and units
are half the dimensions of the model's axis-aligned bounding box.

- [ExtentsOffset](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BillboardGui#ExtentsOffset), which works similarly except
  the offset orientation is relative to the [Camera](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Camera)
- [StudsOffsetWorldSpace](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BillboardGui#StudsOffsetWorldSpace), which works
  similarly except the units are studs
