**StudsOffset** determines how the BillboardGui is offset from its
[Adornee](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BillboardGui#Adornee), relative to the [Camera](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Camera) orientation with
units in studs.

- [StudsOffsetWorldSpace](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BillboardGui#StudsOffsetWorldSpace), which works
  similarly except the offset orientation is relative to the global axes
- [ExtentsOffset](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BillboardGui#ExtentsOffset), which works similarly except
  the units are half the dimensions of the model's Camera-aligned bounding
  box
