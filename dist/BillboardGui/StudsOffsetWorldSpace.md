**StudsOffsetWorldSpace** determines how the BillboardGui is offset from
its [Adornee](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BillboardGui#Adornee), relative to the global axes with units
in studs.

- [StudsOffset](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BillboardGui#StudsOffset), which works similarly except the
  offset orientation is relative to the [Camera](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Camera)
- [ExtentsOffsetWorldSpace](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BillboardGui#ExtentsOffsetWorldSpace), which
  works similarly except the units are half the dimensions of the model's
  axis-aligned bounding box
