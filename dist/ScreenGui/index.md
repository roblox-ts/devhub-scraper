The main storage object for 2D [GuiObject](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/GuiObject) displayed on the player's screen. ScreenGuis will only be shown if parented to a player's [PlayerGui](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/PlayerGui).  
To make sure a ScreenGui is displayed to your player, it should be parented into the [StarterGui](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/StarterGui), as that service will clone it's contents into each player's [PlayerGui](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/PlayerGui) when they join the game.
