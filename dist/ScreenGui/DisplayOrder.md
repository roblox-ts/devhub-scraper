This property controls the Z-index order in which multiple
[`ScreenGuis`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ScreenGui) are drawn. [`ScreenGuis`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ScreenGui) with
a higher [`DisplayOrder`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ScreenGui) will be drawn on top of those with
a lower value.
