A prefix to add to a user's message. This supports Rich Text, so
developers can set custom properties for this text to support chat tags.

which is the `Player.DisplayName` of the user associated with the
[TextSource](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextSource) via `TextSource.UserId`.
