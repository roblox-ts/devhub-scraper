A prefix to add to a user's message. This supports Rich Text, so
developers can set custom properties for this text to support chat tags.

By default, [`TextChatMessage.PrefixText`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextChatMessage#PrefixText) is the name of the
[`TextSource`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextSource), which is the [`Player.DisplayName`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player#DisplayName) of the user
associated with the [`TextSource`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextSource) via [`TextSource.UserId`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextSource#UserId).
