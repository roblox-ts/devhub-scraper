A Hint is an object that creates a small black bar at the very top of the screen with text. Its appearance cannot be customized in any way. With the introduction of Roblox's GUI features it has been deprecated and [TextLabel](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/TextLabel)s should be used instead for new work.

Notes:

*   When a Hint is placed in the [Workspace](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Workspace), it will be visible to everyone
*   When placed under a [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player)'s [PlayerGui](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/PlayerGui), it will be visible only to that player
*   Hints will render if placed in the [CoreGui](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/CoreGui)
