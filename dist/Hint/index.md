A Hint is an object that creates a small black bar at the very top of the
screen with text. Its appearance cannot be customized in any way. With the
introduction of Roblox's GUI features it has been deprecated and
[`TextLabel`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextLabel)s should be used instead for new work.

Notes:

- When a Hint is placed in the [`Workspace`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Workspace), it will be visible to
everyone
- When placed under a [`Player`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player)'s [`PlayerGui`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PlayerGui), it will be visible
only to that player
- Hints will render if placed in the [`CoreGui`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/CoreGui)
