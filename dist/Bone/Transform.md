**Transform** determines the current animated offset of the bone relative to its [CFrame](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Attachment/CFrame). This property is set by Roblox when animations on skinned meshes are played, although it can be manipulated manually in a manner similar to [Motor6D.Transform](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Motor6D/Transform).
