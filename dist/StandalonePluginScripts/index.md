**StandalonePluginScripts** is a container of [Scripts](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Script) to be run in a
standalone plugin [DataModel](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DataModel) when Roblox Studio starts (it is not useful
outside the context of plugins). When a place to be edited is loaded in Roblox
Studio, scripts inside this container are not run.
