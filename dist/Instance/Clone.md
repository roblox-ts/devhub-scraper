**Clone** creates a copy of an object and all of its descendants, ignoring all objects that are not [Archivable](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Instance/Archivable). The copy of the root object is returned by this function and its [Parent](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Instance/Parent) is set to nil.

If a reference property such as [ObjectValue.Value](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/ObjectValue/Value) is set in a cloned object, the value of the copy's property depends on original's value:

*   If a reference property refers to an object that was **also** cloned, an _internal reference_, the copy will refer to the copy.
*   If a reference property refers to an object that was **not** cloned, an _external reference_, the same value is maintained in the copy.

This function is typically used to create models that can be regenerated. First, get a reference to the original object. Then, make a copy of the object and insert the copy by setting its [Parent](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Instance/Parent) to the [Workspace](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Workspace) or one of its descendants. Finally, when it's time to regenerate the model, [Destroy](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Instance/Destroy) the copy and clone a new one from the original like before.
