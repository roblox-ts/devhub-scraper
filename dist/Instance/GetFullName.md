Returns a string describing the [Instance](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Instance)'s ancestry. The string is a concatenation of the [Name](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Instance/Name) of the object and its ancestors, separated by periods. The [DataModel](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/DataModel) (`game`) is not considered. For example, a [Part](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Part) in the [Workspace](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Workspace) may return `Workspace.Part`.

When called on an [Instance](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Instance) that is not a descendant of the [DataModel](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/DataModel), this function considers all ancestors up to and including the topmost one without a [Parent](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Instance/Parent).

This function is useful for logging and debugging. You shouldn't attempt to parse the returned string for any useful operation; this function does not escape periods (or any other symbol) in object names. In other words, although its output often appears to be a valid Lua identifier, it is not guaranteed.
