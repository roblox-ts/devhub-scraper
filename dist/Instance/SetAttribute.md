Attributes are not currently enabled, so this API member may have no effect, emit a warning or raise an error. Do not use it in new work.

This function sets the attribute with the given name to the given value. If the value given is nil, then the attribute will be removed (since nil is returned by default).

For example, the following code snippet will set the instance's `InitialPosition` attribute to `DataType/Vector3|Vector3.new(0, 0, 0)`. Note that this code sample does not define `instance`:

```lua
instance:SetAttribute("InitialPosition", Vector3.new(0, 0, 0))
``` 

Limitations
-----------

*   Names cannot start with Rbx
*   Names cannot be more than 100 characters long
*   Values must be a `supported type`  
    When attempting to set an attribute to an unsupported type, an error will be thrown.
