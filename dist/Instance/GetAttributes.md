This function returns a dictionary of string â†’ variant pairs for each
attribute where the string is the name of the attribute and the variant is
a non-nil value.

For example, the following code snippet will print an instance's
attributes and values. Note that this code sample does not define
[`Instance`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance):
```lua
local attributes = instance:GetAttributes()
for name, value in pairs(attributes) do
    print(name .. " " .. value)
end
```
