This function returns the attribute which has been assigned to the given
name. If no attribute has been assigned then nil is returned.

For example, the following code snippet will set the value of the
instance's `InitialPostion` attribute. Note that this code sample does not
define [`Instance`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance):
```lua
local initialPosition = instance:GetAttribute("InitialPosition")
```
