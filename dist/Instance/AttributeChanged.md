This event fires whenever an attribute is changed on the instance. This
includes when an attribute is set to nil. The name of the attribute that
has been changed is passed to the connected function.

For example, the following code snippet will connect the
`AttributeChanged` function to fire whenever one of [`Instance`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance)'s
attributes changes. Note that this code sample does not define
[`Instance`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance):
```lua
local function attributeChanged(attributeName)
    print(attributeName, "changed")
end

instance.AttributeChanged:Connect(attributeChanged)
```
