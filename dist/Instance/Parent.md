The Parent property determines the hierarchical parent of the
[`Instance`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance). The following terminology is commonly used when talking
about how this property is set:

- An object is a **child** (**parented to**) another object when its
Parent is set to that object.
- The **descendants** of an [`Instance`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance) are the children of that
object, plus the descendants of the children as well.
- The **ancestors** of an [`Instance`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance) are all the objects that the
Instance is a descendant of.

It is from this property that many other API members get their name, such
as [`GetChildren`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance#GetChildren) and
[`FindFirstChild`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance#FindFirstChild).

The [`Remove`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance#Remove) function sets this property to nil.
Calling [`Destroy`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance#Destroy) will set the Parent of an
[`Instance`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance) and all of its descendants to `nil`, and also **lock**
the Parent property. An error is raised when setting the Parent of a
destroyed object.

This property is also used to manage whether an object exists in the game
or needs removed. As long as an objects parent is in the
[`DataModel`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DataModel), is stored in a variable, or is referenced by another
objects property, then the object remains in the game. Otherwise, the
object will automatically be removed. The top level [`DataModel`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DataModel)
object (the one referred to as the `game` by scripts) has no parent, but
always has a reference held to it by the game engine, and exists for the
duration of a session.

Newly created objects using `Datatype.Instance.new()` will not have a
parent, and usually will not be visible or function until one is set. The
most elementary creation of an object has two steps: creating the object,
then setting its parent.
```lua
-- Create a part and parent it to the workspace
local part = Instance.new("Part")
part.Parent = workspace
-- Instance new can also take Parent as a second parameter
Instance.new("NumberValue", workspace)
```
#### Object Replication

An object created by server will not replicate to clients until it is
parented to some object that is replicated. When creating an object then
setting many properties, it's recommended to **set Parent last**. This
ensures the object replicates once, instead of replicating many property
changes.
```lua
local part = Instance.new("Part") -- Avoid using the second parameter here
part.Anchored = true
part.BrickColor = BrickColor.new("Really red")
-- Potentially many other property changes could go here here...
-- Always set parent last!
part.Parent = workspace
```

However, if you were parenting your parts to a [`Model`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Model) whose parent
hasn't been set yet, then setting the parent first would not matter as the
model would not have replicated yet.
