The Parent property determines the hierarchical parent of the [Instance](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Instance). The following terminology is commonly used when talking about how this property is set:

*   An object is a **child** (**parented to**) another object when its Parent is set to that object.
*   The **descendants** of an [Instance](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Instance) are the children of that object, plus the descendants of the children as well.
*   The **ancestors** of an [Instance](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Instance) are all the objects that the Instance is a descendant of.

It is from this property that many other API members get their name, such as [GetChildren](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Instance/GetChildren) and [FindFirstChild](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Instance/FindFirstChild).

The [Remove](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Instance/Remove) function sets this property to nil. Calling [Destroy](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Instance/Destroy) will set the Parent of an [Instance](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Instance) and all of its descendants to `nil`, and also **lock** the Parent property. An error is raised when setting the Parent of a destroyed object.

This property is also used to manage whether an object exists in the game or needs be be removed. As long as an objects parent is in the [DataModel](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/DataModel), is stored in a variable, or is referenced by another objects property, then the object remains in the game. Otherwise, the object will automatically be removed. The top level [DataModel](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/DataModel) object (the one referred to as the `game` by scripts) has no parent, but always has a reference held to it by the game engine, and exists for the duration of a session.

Newly created objects using `Instance.new` will not have a parent, and usually will not be visible or function until one is set. The most elementary creation of an object has two steps: creating the object, then setting its parent.

```Lua
-- Create a part and parent it to the workspace
local part = Instance.new("Part")
part.Parent = workspace
-- Instance new can also take Parent as a second parameter
Instance.new("NumberValue", workspace)
``` 

Object Replication
==================

An object created by server will not replicate to clients until it is parented to some object that is replicated. When creating an object then setting many properties, it's recommended to **set Parent last**. This ensures the object replicates once, instead of replicating many property changes.

```Lua
local part = Instance.new("Part") -- Avoid using the second parameter here
part.Anchored = true
part.BrickColor = BrickColor.new("Really red")
-- Potentially many other property changes could go here here...
-- Always set parent last!
part.Parent = workspace
``` 

However, if you were parenting your parts to a [Model](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Model) whose parent hasn't been set yet, then setting the parent first would not matter as the model would not have replicated yet.
