This function returns an event that behaves exactly like the `Changed`
event, except that the event only fires when the given attribute changes.
It's generally a good idea to use this method instead of a connection to
Changed with a function that checks the attribute name. Subsequent calls
to this method on the same object with the same attribute name return the
same event.

It is similar to [`Instance:GetPropertyChangedSignal()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance#GetPropertyChangedSignal) but for
attributes.

For example, the following code snippet will return a signal that fires
the function [`Instance.AttributeChanged`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance#AttributeChanged) when the instance's
`InitialPosition` attribute changes. Note that this code sample does not
define [`Instance`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance):
```lua
local function attributeChanged()
    print("Attribute changed")
end

instance:GetAttributeChangedSignal("InitialPosition"):Connect(attributeChanged)
```
