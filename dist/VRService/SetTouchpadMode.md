The SetTouchpadMode function sets the mode of the specified
[`Enum.VRTouchpad`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/VRTouchpad) to the specified [`Enum.VRTouchpadMode`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/VRTouchpadMode).

This can be used to change the user's virtual reality (VR) touchpad mode
so that the user interacts with the game different using the touchpad. For
more information about the different types of modes, see the
[`Enum.VRTouchpadMode`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/VRTouchpadMode) page.

This can also be used alongside the several [`UserInputService`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UserInputService) VR
functions and events.

Since [`VRService`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/VRService) only runs client-side, this function will only
work when used in a [`LocalScript`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/LocalScript).
