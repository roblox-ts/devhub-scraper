The VRService is a service that is responsible for handling interactions
between Roblox and Virtual Reality (VR). If you're interested in incorporating
VR compatibility into your game, this is the service for you!

The primary purpose of this service is to allow for games to communication and
cooperate with virtual reality decisions - such as VR headsets and
controllers. It allows a LocalScript to perform different actions depending on
the device, and in turn, helps developers provide the best experience for the
end user seeking to experience Roblox using VR devices.

Some usages of this service include detecting whether a user has any connected
VR devices, tracking when those devices move, and determining how those
devices interact with the user's in-game controls. In order to detect user
input, the service must look for a service event. For example, the service can
detect VR device movement via events such as [VRService.UserCFrameChanged](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/VRService#UserCFrameChanged).

## Notes

1.  The [UserInputService](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UserInputService) also contains several events and functions useful
    for enhancing a player's VR experience in your game.
2.  Since this service is client-side only, it will only work when used in a
    [LocalScript](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/LocalScript). It will not work when used within a [Script](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Script). Client-side
    only means that users in the game can only detect their own input - and
    not the input of other users.
