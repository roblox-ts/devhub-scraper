**VRService** is responsible for handling interactions between Roblox and
Virtual Reality (VR). Its methods, properties, and events help you provide the
best experience for end users seeking to experience Roblox on VR devices.

Since this service is client-side only, it will only work when used in a
[`LocalScript`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/LocalScript) or a [`Script`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Script) with
[`RunContext`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Script#RunContext) of `Enum.RunContext|Client`.

See [VR Guidelines](https://create.roblox.com/docs/production/publishing/vr-guidelines) for more
information on publishing an experience for VR devices.
