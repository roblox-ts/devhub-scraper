The VRDeviceName property indicates the name of a connected Virtual Reality (VR) device. You can use this property to check the name of a connected VR device.

To check if Roblox detects any VR devices, you can check the [VRService.VREnabled](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/VRService/VREnabled) property.

Since [VRService](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/VRService) only runs client-side, this property will only work when used in a [LocalScript](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/LocalScript).
