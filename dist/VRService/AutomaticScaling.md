When [`VRService.AutomaticScaling`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/VRService#AutomaticScaling) is set to `World`,
[`Camera.HeadScale`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Camera#HeadScale) adjusts so that the scale of the world is seen
from the avatar's perspective. A player with a small avatar will perceive
the objects around them as larger than a player with a large avatar will.
