Determines the background transparency of the default bubble chat as a
number between 0 and 1. This value is multiplied with the user's
[`GuiService.PreferredTransparency`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiService#PreferredTransparency) to create the effective
background transparency used by the bubble chat, which may be more opaque
than this value set here. Default value is 0.1.
