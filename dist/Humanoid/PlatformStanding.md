This event fires when the [`Humanoid`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid) enters or leaves the
*PlatformStanding* [`Enum.HumanoidStateType`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/HumanoidStateType).

Whilst the [`Humanoid`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid) is in the *PlatformStanding* state, the
[`Humanoid.PlatformStand`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid#PlatformStand) property will be *true*.

Whilst [`Humanoid.PlatformStand`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid#PlatformStand) is set to *true*, the
[`Humanoid`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid) will be unable to move. For more information please see
the page for [`Humanoid.PlatformStand`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid#PlatformStand).

The PlatformStand [`Enum.HumanoidStateType`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/HumanoidStateType) was associated with the now
disabled [`Platform`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Platform) part. Despite this, it can still be used by
developers.
