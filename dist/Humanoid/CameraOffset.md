The CameraOffset property specifies an offset to the [Camera](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Camera)'s subject
position when its [Camera.CameraSubject](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Camera#CameraSubject) is set to this [Humanoid](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid).

The offset is applied in object-space, relative to the orientation of the
Humanoid's _HumanoidRootPart_. For example, an offset [Vector3](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/datatype/Vector3)
value of _(0, 10, 0)_ offsets the player's camera to 10 studs above the
player's humanoid.
