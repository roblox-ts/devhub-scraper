The CameraOffset property specifies an offset to the [`Camera`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Camera)'s
subject position when its [`Camera.CameraSubject`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Camera#CameraSubject) is set to this
[`Humanoid`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid).

The offset is applied in object-space, relative to the orientation of the
Humanoid's *HumanoidRootPart*. For example, an offset [`Vector3`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/datatypes/Vector3)
value of *(0, 10, 0)* offsets the player's camera to 10 studs above the
player's humanoid.
