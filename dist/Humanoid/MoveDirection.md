MoveDirection is a read-only property that describes the direction a [Humanoid](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Humanoid) is walking in, as a unit vector along the X/Z axis. The direction is described in world space.

Because the property is read-only, it cannot be set by a [Script](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Script) or [LocalScript](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/LocalScript).
