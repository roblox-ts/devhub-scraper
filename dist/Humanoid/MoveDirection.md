**MoveDirection** is a read-only property that describes the direction a
[`Humanoid`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid) is walking in, as a unit vector or zero length vector.
The direction is described in world space.

Because this property is read-only, it cannot be set by a [`Script`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Script)
or [`LocalScript`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/LocalScript).
