![A visualization of how WalkToPart changes the behavior of WalkToPoint](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/bltc76671f1665d7da0/WalkToPart.gif)

WalkToPart is a reference to a part that the Humanoid is trying to reach. This property is normally set when a part is passed as the 2nd argument of the Humanoid's [Humanoid:MoveTo](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Humanoid/MoveTo) function.

When WalkToPart is set and a humanoid is actively trying to reach the part, it will keep updating its Vector3 goal to be the position of the part, plus the [Humanoid.WalkToPoint](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Humanoid/WalkToPoint) translated in object space relative to the rotation of the part.

This can be described in Lua as:

```lua
goal = humanoid.WalkToPart.CFrame:pointToObjectSpace(humanoid.WalkToPoint)
``` 

Caveats
-------

*   Setting the value of WalkToPart isn't sufficient enough to make a humanoid start following a part.
*   The Humanoid is prompted to start attempting to reach a goal when the value of WalkToPoint is changed.
*   This may be changed in the future.
*   The _reach goal_ state of a humanoid will timeout after 8 seconds if it doesn't reach its goal.
*   This is done so that NPCs won't get stuck waiting for [Humanoid.MoveToFinished](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/Humanoid/MoveToFinished) to fire.
*   If you don't want this to happen, you should repeatedly call MoveTo so that the timeout will keep resetting.
