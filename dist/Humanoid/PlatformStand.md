PlatformStand describes whether the [Humanoid](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Humanoid) is currently in the _PlatformStanding_ [HumanoidStateType](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/enum/HumanoidStateType). When true, the Humanoid is in a state where it is free-falling and cannot move. This state behaves similar to sitting, except that jumping does not free the humanoid from the state.

The now-deprecated [SkateboardPlatform](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/SkateboardPlatform) puts the Humanoid into this state, much like how a [Seat](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Seat) causes a sitting state.
