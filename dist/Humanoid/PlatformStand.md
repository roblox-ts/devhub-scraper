PlatformStand describes whether the [`Humanoid`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid) is currently in the
*PlatformStanding* [`Enum.HumanoidStateType`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/HumanoidStateType). When true, the Humanoid is in
a state where it is free-falling and cannot move. This state behaves
similar to sitting, except that jumping does not free the humanoid from
the state.

The now-deprecated [`SkateboardPlatform`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SkateboardPlatform) puts the Humanoid into this
state, much like how a [`Seat`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Seat) causes a sitting state.
