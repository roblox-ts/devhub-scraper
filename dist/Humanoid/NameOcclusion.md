Controls whether a humanoid's name and health bar can be seen behind walls
or other objects. This property is a `Enum.NameOcclusion` value and can be
configured to occlude all names, enemy names, or disable occlusion
entirely.

In cases where the [`LocalPlayer`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Players#LocalPlayer) has no
[`Humanoid`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid) associated with it, this property instead applies to the
subject [`Humanoid`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid).

See
[Character Name/Health Display](https://create.roblox.com/docs/characters/name-health-display)
for an in-depth guide on controlling the appearance of character names and
health bars.
