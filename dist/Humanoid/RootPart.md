![The HumanoidRootPart made visible!][1]

A reference to the [Humanoid's](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid) HumanoidRootPart, which is the
root driving part of the Humanoid, that controls a humanoid's movement
through the game world. This part is normally invisible.

Note:

- In the case of [Player](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player) [Characters](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player#Character) the RootPart is
  also the [Model.PrimaryPart](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Model#PrimaryPart) of the [Player.Character](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player#Character) [Model](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Model)
- The RootPart is the [RootPart](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#GetRootPart) of the [Humanoid](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid)
  [Model's](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Model) assembly. As such, if a developer wishes to move the
  [Humanoid](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid) they should do so via the RootPart
