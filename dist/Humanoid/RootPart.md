A reference to the humanoid's **HumanoidRootPart** object, the root
driving part of the [`Humanoid`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid) that controls a humanoid's movement
through the 3D world. This part is normally invisible.

Note that in the case of player characters, **RootPart** is the same as
the [`Model.PrimaryPart`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Model#PrimaryPart) of the [`Player.Character`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player#Character) model.
