ReplaceBodyPartR15 dynamically replaces a R15/Rthro limb part in a
Humanoid with a different part. The part is automatically scaled as
normal. In the image below, a R15 avatar has had their right hand replaced
with a slightly larger version (also pictured).

This function is useful for modifying characters during gameplay or
building characters from a base rig. The related function
[`GetBodyPartR15`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid#GetBodyPartR15) can come in handy when
using this function.

The name of the part passed in should match with the name of the
BodyPartR15 Enum passed in.
