The Humanoid has six child scale values including `BodyDepthScale`,
`BodyHeightScale`, `BodyProportionScale`, `BodyTypeScale`,
`BodyWidthScale`, `HeadScale`. Changing the value of any of these causes
the character's body parts and accessories to change size, but only if
`AutomaticScalingEnabled` is true.
