Provides control over the height a [Humanoid](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Humanoid) jumps in studs. The starting value of this property is determined by the value of [StarterPlayer.CharacterJumpHeight](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/StarterPlayer/CharacterJumpHeight), which defaults to 7.2.

This property is only visible in the Properties window if [Humanoid.UseJumpPower](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Humanoid/UseJumpPower) is set to **false**, as it would not be relevant otherwise.

This property can be used to adjust the height that a humanoid can jump, allowing developers to remove jumping, allow dynamically adjustable jump height based on character stats or raise the jump height (as if on the moon or such).
