SeatPart is a reference to the seat that a [`Humanoid`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid) is currently
sitting in, if any. The value of this property can be either a
[`Seat`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Seat), or a [`VehicleSeat`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/VehicleSeat). It will be *nil* if the Humanoid
is not currently sitting in a seat.

Note:

- For a bool describing if the [`Humanoid`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid) is currently sitting or
not, see [`Humanoid.Sit`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid#Sit)
