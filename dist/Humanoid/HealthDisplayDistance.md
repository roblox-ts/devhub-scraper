The **HealthDisplayDistance** property is a number used in conjunction
with the [`Humanoid.DisplayDistanceType`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid#DisplayDistanceType) property to control the
distance from which a humanoid's health bar can be seen.

See
[Character Name/Health Display](https://create.roblox.com/docs/characters/name-health-display)
for an in-depth guide on controlling the appearance of character names and
health bars.
