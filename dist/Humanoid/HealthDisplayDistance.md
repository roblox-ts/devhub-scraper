HealthDisplayDistance is a number used in conjunction with the [Humanoid](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Humanoid)'s [Humanoid.DisplayDistanceType](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Humanoid/DisplayDistanceType) property to control how far a humanoid's health bar can be seen from in studs.

The DisplayDistanceType property is to one of three values using the [HumanoidDisplayDistanceType](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/enum/HumanoidDisplayDistanceType) enum.

DisplayDistanceType set to “None”##
-----------------------------------

When a humanoid's DisplayDistanceType is set to **None**, its health bar will never be visible to anyone under any circumstances.

* * *

DisplayDistanceType set to “Viewer”##
-------------------------------------

When a humanoid's DisplayDistanceType is set to **Viewer**, the visibility of its health bar is dependent upon the HealthDisplayDistance of the player viewing it.

If the distance between the character models of the viewer and the humanoid is outside the range of the viewer's HealthDisplayDistance, then the health bar will not be shown to the viewer.

* * *

DisplayDistanceType set to “Subject”##
--------------------------------------

When a humanoid's DisplayDistanceType is set to **Subject**, the visibility of its health bar is dependent upon the value of the humanoid's own HealthDisplayDistance.

If the distance between the character models of the viewing player and the humanoid is outside the range of the humanoid's HealthDisplayDistance, then the health bar will not be shown to the viewing player.
