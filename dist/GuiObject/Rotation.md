This property determines the number of degrees by which a [GUI](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/GuiObject) is rotated. Rotation is relative to the **center** of its parent GUI.

A GUI's [GuiObject.AnchorPoint](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/GuiObject/AnchorPoint) does not influence it's rotation. This means that you cannot change the center of rotation since it will always be in the center of the object.

Additionally, this property is **not compatible** with [GuiObject.ClipsDescendants](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/GuiObject/ClipsDescendants). If an ancestor (parent) object has ClipsDescendants enabled and this property is nonzero, then descendant GUI elements will not be clipped.
