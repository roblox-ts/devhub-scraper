This event fires when a user begins interacting with the [`GuiObject`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiObject)
via a Human-Computer Interface device (Mouse button down, touch begin,
keyboard button down, etc).

The [`UserInputService`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UserInputService) has a similarly named event that is not
restricted to a specific UI element: [`UserInputService.InputBegan`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UserInputService#InputBegan).

This event will always fire regardless of game state.
