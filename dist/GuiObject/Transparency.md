This property is deprecated, and a mix of
[GuiObject.BackgroundTransparency](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiObject#BackgroundTransparency) and [TextLabel.TextTransparency](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextLabel#TextTransparency).

When indexing, this will return the BackgroundTranparency.

When setting, this will change the BackgroundTransparency **and**
TextTransparency of a [GUI](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiObject) element.
