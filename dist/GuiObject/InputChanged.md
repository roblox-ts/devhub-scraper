This event fires when a user changes how they're interacting via a Human-Computer Interface device (Mouse button down, touch begin, keyboard button down, etc).

The [UserInputService](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/UserInputService) has a similarly named event that is not restricted to a specific UI element: [UserInputService.InputChanged](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/UserInputService/InputChanged).

This event will always fire regardless of game state.
