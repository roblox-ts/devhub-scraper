This event fires when a user changes how they're interacting via a
Human-Computer Interface device (Mouse button down, touch begin, keyboard
button down, etc).

The [`UserInputService`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UserInputService) has a similarly named event that is not
restricted to a specific UI element:
[`UserInputService.InputChanged`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UserInputService#InputChanged).

This event will always fire regardless of game state.
