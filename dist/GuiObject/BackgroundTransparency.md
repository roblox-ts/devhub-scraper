This property determines the transparency of the [GUI's](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiObject)
background and border.

It does not, however, determine the transparency of text if the GUI is a
`Textbox`, [TextButton](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextButton), or [TextLabel](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextLabel). Text transparency is determined
[TextBox.TextTransparency|](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextBox#TextTransparency|), [TextButton.TextTransparency](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextButton#TextTransparency), and
[TextLabel.TextTransparency](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextLabel#TextTransparency) respectively.

If the property is set to 1, neither the background nor the border will
render and the GUI will be completely transparent.
