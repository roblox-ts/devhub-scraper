The [`UIStroke`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UIStroke) component allows for more advanced border effects.

**BorderMode** determines in what manner a GuiObject's border is laid out
relative to its dimensions. It does this using the enum of the same name,
[`Enum.BorderMode`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/BorderMode). See the animation below to understand how the layout
changes as [`GuiObject.BorderSizePixel`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiObject#BorderSizePixel) increases.
