This property determines the color of a [`UI`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiObject) background
(the fill color).

Another property that determines the visual properties of the background
is [`GuiObject.BackgroundTransparency`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiObject#BackgroundTransparency). If an element's
BackgroundTransparency is set to 1, neither the background nor the border
will render and the element will be transparent.

If your element contains text, such as a [`TextBox`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextBox),
[`TextButton`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextButton), or [`TextLabel`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextLabel), make sure the color of your
background contrasts the text's color.
