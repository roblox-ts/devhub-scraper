This property is used to automatically size parent UI objects based on the size of its descendants. Developers can use this property to dynamically add text and other content to a UI object at edit or run time, and the size will adjust to fit that content.

When AutomaticSize is set to an `Enum/AutomaticSize|Enum.AutomaticSize` value to anything other than None, this UI object may resize depending on its child content.

For more information on how to use this property and how it works, please see the following article: [How to use AutomaticSize](../../../articles/ui-automaticsize).
