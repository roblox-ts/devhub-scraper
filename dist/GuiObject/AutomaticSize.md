This property is used to automatically size parent UI objects based on the
size of its descendants. Developers can use this property to dynamically
add text and other content to a UI object at edit or run time, and the
size will adjust to fit that content.

When AutomaticSize is set to an [`Enum.AutomaticSize`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/AutomaticSize)
value to anything other than None, this UI object may resize depending on
its child content.

For more information on how to use this property and how it works, please
