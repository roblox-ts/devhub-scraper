The **AnchorPoint** property determines the origin point of a
[`GuiObject`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiObject), relative to its absolute size. The origin point
determines from where the element is positioned (through
[`GuiObject.Position`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiObject#Position)) and from which the rendered
[`GuiObject.Size`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiObject#Size) expands.

See [here](https://create.roblox.com/docs/ui/positioning-and-sizing#anchorpoint) for
illustrated diagrams and details.
