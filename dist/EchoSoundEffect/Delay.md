Range: 0.01 to 5 (default 1)

The amount of time between echoes. Measured in seconds.

If a EchoSoundEffect is applied to a singular sound instead of a sound group, if the sound stops playing before the delay causes an echo, the echo will not play. Because of this, it is recommended to apply echo effects to SoundGroups and not Sounds.
