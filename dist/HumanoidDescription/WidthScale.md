**WidthScale** determines by what factor the width (left-to-right
distance) of a [`Humanoid`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid) is scaled, as well as all accessories not
attached to its head. When the description is
[`applied`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid#ApplyDescription) to a Humanoid, this value maps
to a "BodyWidthScale" [`NumberValue`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/NumberValue) within the Humanoid.

In the image above, three R15 figures whose [`Humanoid`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid)s have
[`HumanoidDescription`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HumanoidDescription)s applied with the following WidthScale values
(from left-to-right): 0.5, 1.0, 1.5.
