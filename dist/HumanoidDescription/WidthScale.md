**WidthScale** determines by what factor the width (left-to-right distance) of a [Humanoid](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Humanoid) is scaled, as well as all accessories not attached to its head. When the description is [applied](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Humanoid/ApplyDescription) to a Humanoid, this value maps to a “BodyWidthScale” [NumberValue](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/NumberValue) within the Humanoid.

In the image above, three R15 figures whose [Humanoid](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Humanoid)s have [HumanoidDescription](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/HumanoidDescription)s applied with the following WidthScale values (from left-to-right): 0.5, 1.0, 1.5.
