**BackAccessory** is a comma-separated list of asset IDs that determine
what accessories should be added when the description is
[applied](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid#ApplyDescription). The list cannot contain duplicates.

An error is thrown if you try to apply a new description which shares any
assets with the existing description but a different accessory property.
