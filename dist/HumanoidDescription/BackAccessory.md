**BackAccessory** is a comma-separated list of asset IDs that determine what accessories should be added when the description is [applied](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Humanoid/ApplyDescription). The list is kept sorted in descending order without duplicates.

Any accessory can used in this property, even if it is meant to go in a different accessory spot. For example, an accessory meant to go on your back (such as a cape) could be included in [HairAccessory](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/HumanoidDescription/HairAccessory). An error is thrown if you try to apply a new description which shares any assets with the existing description but a different accessory property.
