**HeadScale** determines by what factor the Head of a [Humanoid](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid) is
scaled, as well as any accessories attached to it (such as those specified
by [HatAccessory](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HumanoidDescription#HatAccessory) and
[HairAccessory](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HumanoidDescription#HairAccessory)). When the description
is [applied](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid#ApplyDescription) to a Humanoid, this value maps to a
"HeadScale" [NumberValue](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/NumberValue) within the Humanoid.

In the image, three R15 figures whose [Humanoid](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid)s have
[HumanoidDescription](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HumanoidDescription)s applied with the following HeadScale values (from
left-to-right): 0.5, 1.0, 1.5.
