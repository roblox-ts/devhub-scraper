**HeightScale** determines by what factor the height (top-to-bottom
distance) of a [Humanoid](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid) is scaled, as well as all accessories not
attached to its head. When the description is
[applied](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid#ApplyDescription) to a Humanoid, this value maps to a
"BodyHeightScale" [NumberValue](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/NumberValue) within the Humanoid.

In the image, three R15 figures whose [Humanoid](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid)s have
[HumanoidDescription](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HumanoidDescription)s applied with the following HeightScale values (from
left-to-right): 0.5, 1.0, 1.5.
