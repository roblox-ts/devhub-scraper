**Shirt** determines the [`ShirtTemplate`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Shirt#ShirtTemplate) used by
a [`Shirt`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Shirt) when [`applied`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid#ApplyDescription) to a
[`Humanoid`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid). The asset type **must be for a Shirt** and not a Decal
or Image.
