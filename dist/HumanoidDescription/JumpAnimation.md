When this description is [`applied`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid#ApplyDescription) to a
[`Humanoid`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid), **JumpAnimation** determines the
[`Animation.AnimationId`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Animation#AnimationId) to play when its
[`state`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid#GetState) is [`Jumping`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/HumanoidStateType).
