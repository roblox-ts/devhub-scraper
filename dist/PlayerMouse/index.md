The PlayerMouse behaves identically to the [Mouse](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Mouse) object that is obtained using [Tool.Equipped](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/Tool/Equipped). It can be accessed from [LocalScript](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/LocalScript)s using the local player's [Player:GetMouse](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Player/GetMouse) method.

The only difference between the PlayerMouse and the [Mouse](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Mouse) object is the PlayerMouse can be obtained using the [Player:GetMouse](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Player/GetMouse) method.

In most cases developers are advised to use the new [UserInputService](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/UserInputService). However the PlayerMouse and Mouse objects remain supported for a number of reasons.

For more information on how to use the mouse object, see the [Mouse](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Mouse) page.
