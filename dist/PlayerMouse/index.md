The PlayerMouse behaves identically to the [Mouse](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Mouse) object that is obtained
using [Tool.Equipped](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Tool#Equipped). It can be accessed from [LocalScript](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/LocalScript)s using the local
player's [Player:GetMouse](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player#GetMouse) method.

The only difference between the PlayerMouse and the [Mouse](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Mouse) object is the
PlayerMouse can be obtained using the [Player:GetMouse](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player#GetMouse) method.

In most cases developers are advised to use the new [UserInputService](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UserInputService).
However the PlayerMouse and Mouse objects remain supported for a number of
reasons.

For more information on how to use the mouse object, see the [Mouse](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Mouse) page.
