Sets whether the [`BallSocketConstraint`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BallSocketConstraint) sets a limit on twist
rotation based on
[`TwistUpperAngle`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BallSocketConstraint#TwistUpperAngle) and
[`TwistLowerAngle`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BallSocketConstraint#TwistLowerAngle). The twist
angle is defined as the angle between the **Y** axis of
[`Attachment1`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Constraint#Attachment1) and the **Y** axis of
[`Attachment0`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Constraint#Attachment0).
