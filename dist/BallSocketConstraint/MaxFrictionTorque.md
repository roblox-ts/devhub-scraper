Sets the maximum frictional torque applied to keep its
[`Attachments`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Attachment) aligned.

`MaxFrictionTorque` specifies the stiffness of the
[`BallSocketConstraint`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BallSocketConstraint) (how much it resists rotation around its
[`Attachments`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Attachment)).
