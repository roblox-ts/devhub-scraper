Sets the maximum frictional torque applied to keep its
[Attachments](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Attachment) aligned.

`MaxFrictionTorque` specifies the stiffness of the [BallSocketConstraint](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BallSocketConstraint),
i.e. how much it resists rotation around its [Attachments](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Attachment).
Constrained to be greater than or equal to 0.
