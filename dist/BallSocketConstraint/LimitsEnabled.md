Sets whether the [`BallSocketConstraint`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BallSocketConstraint) has a limit on rotation
based on [`UpperAngle`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BallSocketConstraint#UpperAngle). When true, it
enforces that its [`Attachment1`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Constraint#Attachment1) isn't rotated
more than a set angle from its [`Attachment0`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Constraint#Attachment0).
