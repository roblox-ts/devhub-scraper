This property, when enabled, causes the constraint to apply equal and opposite reaction forces. This is important if the two attached parts can collide, since without reaction forces collisions can create energy that would otherwise be disregarded.

When enabled, the reaction forces cause the constraint to act like an angular motor between the two attachments.

It is only meaningful and visible in studio when [AngularVelocity.RelativeTo](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/AngularVelocity/RelativeTo) is set to `Attachment1`.
