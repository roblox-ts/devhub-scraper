The [CFrame](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/datatype/CFrame) in which the [AngularVelocity](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/AngularVelocity) force is specified. If set to **[World](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/enum/ActuatorRelativeToWorld)**, the angular velocity vector is used as is. If set to **Attachment1**, the angular velocity is transformed by the CFrame of the assigned attachment.

[RelativeTo](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/AngularVelocity/RelativeTo) can also be set to **Attachment0**, but it makes no physical sense and will lead to unpredictable behaviors. There will be a warning in Studio but the API will not prevent setting this value.
