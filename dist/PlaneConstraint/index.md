Constrains Attachment0 and Attachment1 such that both points lie in an plane
defined by Attachment0. The plane origin is at Attachment0 and the plane unit
normal is the primary axis of Attachment0. This means that Attachment0 and
Attachment1 will move to a position/orientation such that the distance between
Attachment1 and Attachment0, projected onto the Plane unit normal, is zero.
