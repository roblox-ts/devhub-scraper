A **PlaneConstraint** moves its [`Attachment0`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Constraint#Attachment0) and
[`Attachment1`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Constraint#Attachment1) into a position/orientation along a
plane whose normal vector is the primary axis of
[`Attachment0`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Constraint#Attachment0). Both parent assemblies remain free
to translate and rotate unless otherwise constrained.
