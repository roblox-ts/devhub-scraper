This property is automatically set to true when a LocalizationTable's Root targets this object, or an ancestor of this object. `LocalizationTable/LocalizationTable`s, with their [LocalizationTable.Root](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/LocalizationTable/Root) property pointed at an instance, will localize all `TextLabel/TextButton` that are descendants of the root instance.
