This property is automatically set to true when a LocalizationTable's Root
targets this object, or an ancestor of this object.
[`LocalizationTable.LocalizationTable`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/LocalizationTable#LocalizationTable)s, with their
[`LocalizationTable.Root`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/LocalizationTable#Root) property pointed at an instance, will
localize all [`TextLabel.TextButton`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextLabel#TextButton) that are descendants of the root
instance.
