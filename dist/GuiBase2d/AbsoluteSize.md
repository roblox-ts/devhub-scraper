AbsoluteSize is a read-only property that provides the screen size of a UI element in pixels. This represents the actual pixel size at which an element renders as a result of its ancestors' sizes. This property, [GuiBase2d.AbsolutePosition](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/GuiBase2d/AbsolutePosition) and [GuiBase2d.AbsoluteRotation](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/GuiBase2d/AbsoluteRotation) are a group of properties that all describe the final rendered orientation of a UI element.

For example, on a 1920 by 1080 screen, if FrameA exists within FrameB, and they both have a Size of {.5, 0}, {.5, 0}, then the AbsoluteSize of FrameA (the inner frame) would be (490, 270) as the [GuiObject.Size](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/GuiObject/Size) property determines the size of a child UI element relative to its parent. Both of the frames are set to 50% of the parent size. Since 50% of 50% is 25%, and 25% of our screen size, 1920 by 1080, is (490, 270), this would be the resultant AbsoluteSize of the inner frame.
