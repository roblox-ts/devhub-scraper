This property determines how the collision model of the
[`TriangleMeshPart`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TriangleMeshPart) relates to the actual geometry of the mesh. This
property cannot be read or manipulated by scripts during runtime.

See [here](https://create.roblox.com/docs/workspace/collisions#collision-fidelity) for a
visual representation of the various options.
