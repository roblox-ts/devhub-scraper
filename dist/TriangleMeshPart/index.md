TriangleMeshPart is an abstract intermediate class from which [MeshPart](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/MeshPart) and
[PartOperation](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PartOperation) inherit. It was created to consolidate the management of
physical geometry properties between the two sub-classes. It implements the
read-only [CollisionFidelity](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TriangleMeshPart#CollisionFidelity).
