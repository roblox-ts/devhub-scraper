TriangleMeshPart is an abstract intermediate class from which [MeshPart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/MeshPart) and [PartOperation](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/PartOperation) inherit. It was created to consolidate the management of physical geometry properties between the two sub-classes. It implements the read-only [CollisionFidelity](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/TriangleMeshPart/CollisionFidelity).
