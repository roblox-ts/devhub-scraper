The **RespectFilteringEnabled** property determines whether [Sound](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Sound) playback is replicated from the client to the server, and therefore from server . In other words, when a [LocalScript](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/LocalScript) calls [Sound:Play](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Sound/Play) and this property is **true**, the sound will only play on the respective client. If the property is false, other clients will also hear the sound.
