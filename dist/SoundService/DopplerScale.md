This property determines the degree to with a 3D [`Sound`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Sound)s pitch
varies due to the Doppler effect.

The Doppler effect describes a phenomenon whereby the pitch of a sound
changes as the source and observer of the sound move further away, or
closer together. The Doppler effect can often be seen in real life, such
as when a car with a siren drives past.

Increasing this value exaggerates the impact of the Doppler effect,
whereas decreasing it minimizes it. By default, the value of this property
is 1.
```lua
local SoundService = game:GetService("SoundService")
SoundService.DopplerScale = 1 -- default
SoundService.DopplerScale = 2 -- exaggerated Doppler effect
SoundService.DopplerEffect = 0.5 -- subdued Doppler effect
```

Note the Doppler effect has no impact on 2D [`Sound`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Sound)s,
([`Sound`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Sound)s not parented to a [`BasePart`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart) or [`Attachment`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Attachment)).

Developers wishing to learn more about the different settings Roblox's
sound engine uses should consult the
