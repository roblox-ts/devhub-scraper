The ambient sound environment preset used by [`SoundService`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SoundService).

The [`Enum.ReverbType`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/ReverbType) this property simulates a range of different
environment's impact on sound. Each different option corresponds with a
preset available in the FMOD sound engine. For example, when AmbientReverb
is set to Hangar, the sound will reverberate differently to simulate being
in a large enclosed space.

Changing the AmbientReverb effects the following properties used by
Roblox's sound engine.

- Reverberation decay time
- Initial reflection delay time
- Late reverberation delay time relative to initial reflection
- Reference high frequency
- High-frequency to mid-frequency decay time ratio
- Value that controls the echo density in the late reverberation decay
- Value that controls the modal density in the late reverberation decay
- Reference low frequency
- Relative room effect level at low frequencies
- Relative room effect level at high frequencies
- Early reflections level relative to room effect
- Room effect level at mid frequencies

Those interested in finding more out about ambient reverb presets should
see the
[FMOD documentation on the topic](https://create.roblox.com/docs/https://www.fmod.com/docs/api/content/generated/FMOD_REVERB_PRESETS.html).
For most developers however, the [`Enum.ReverbType`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/ReverbType) names are descriptive
enough to be able to use this setting without advanced knowledge.
