This function is used to retrieve a temporary asset id associated with
this [`File`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/File). This id can be used like an *rbxassetid* - for example,
it can be assigned to the Image property of an [`ImageLabel`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ImageLabel).

Throws an error if the file does not exist on disk.
