Returns an array containing all sub [`Pose`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Pose)s that have been added to
a [`Pose`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Pose). This is functionally the same as using the
[`Instance:GetChildren()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance#GetChildren) function on the [`Pose`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Pose).

Note: this function returns all children of the [`Pose`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Pose), including
non [`Pose`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Pose) [`Instance`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance)s if any are present.
