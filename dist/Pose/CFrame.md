The `CFrame` that will be applied to the [Motor6D](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Motor6D) corresponding with the [Pose](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Pose). This `CFrame` is applied by changing the `Motor6D\Transform` property of the motor. The original `Motor6D/C0` and `Motor6D/C1` values are not changed.

[Pose](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Pose) objects are arranged in a [Keyframe](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Keyframe) based on joint hierarchy. This means, the the [Pose.CFrame](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Pose/CFrame) is applied to the motor connecting the part associated with the pose to the part associated with the pose's parent.
