This function removes a sub [Pose](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Pose) from the [Pose](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Pose) by parenting it to nil. It is functionally identical to setting the new pose's [Instance.Parent](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Instance/Parent) to nil.

Note, this function will not error when an instance other than a [Pose](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Pose) is given as the pose parameter and remove it successfully.
