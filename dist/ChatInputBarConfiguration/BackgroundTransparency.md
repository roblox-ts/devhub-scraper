Determines the background transparency of the default chat input bar as a
number between 0 and 1. This value is multiplied with the user's
[`GuiService.PreferredTransparency`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiService#PreferredTransparency) to create the effective
background transparency used by the chat input bar, which may be more
opaque than this value set here. Default value is 0.2.
