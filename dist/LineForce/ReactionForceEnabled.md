Enables a reaction force (equal an opposite) to be applied to the parent
of [`Attachment1`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Constraint#Attachment1). By default line force only
applies a force on the parent of
[`Attachment0`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Constraint#Attachment0) and uses
[`Attachment1`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Constraint#Attachment1) as the target direction without
any dynamic relationship.
