This property specifies the sharpness of the linear servo motor in
reaching the [SlidingBallConstraint.TargetPosition](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SlidingBallConstraint#TargetPosition), when the derived
classes' actuator type is set to **Servo**, for example the
[CylindricalConstraint](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/CylindricalConstraint) and [PrismaticConstraint](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PrismaticConstraint). Larger values
correspond to faster a response and smaller values results in more damping
and a slower response.
