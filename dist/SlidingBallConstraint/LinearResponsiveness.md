This property specifies the sharpness of the linear servo motor in reaching the [SlidingBallConstraint.TargetPosition](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/SlidingBallConstraint/TargetPosition), when the derived classes' actuator type is set to **Servo**, for example the [CylindricalConstraint](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/CylindricalConstraint) and [PrismaticConstraint](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/PrismaticConstraint). Larger values correspond to faster a response and smaller values results in more damping and a slower response.
