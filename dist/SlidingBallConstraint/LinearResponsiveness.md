Specifies the "sharpness" of the linear servo motor in reaching the
[`TargetPosition`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SlidingBallConstraint#TargetPosition) when the
derived classes' actuator type is set to [`Servo`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/ActuatorType). Larger
values correspond to faster a response and smaller values results in more
damping and a slower response.
