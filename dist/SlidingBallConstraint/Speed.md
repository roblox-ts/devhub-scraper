The desired speed a [SlidingBallConstraint](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SlidingBallConstraint) with
[SlidingBallConstraint.ActuatorType](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SlidingBallConstraint#ActuatorType) set to [ActuatorType](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/enum/ActuatorType) will
attempt to maintain while translating towards its
[SlidingBallConstraint.TargetPosition](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SlidingBallConstraint#TargetPosition). Measured in studs/second.
