The constraint's desired speed when
[`ActuatorType`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SlidingBallConstraint#ActuatorType) is set to
[`Servo`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/ActuatorType), as the constraint translates towards its
[`TargetPosition`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SlidingBallConstraint#TargetPosition). Measured in
studs per second.
