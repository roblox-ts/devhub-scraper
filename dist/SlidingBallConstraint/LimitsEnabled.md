Sets whether the [`SlidingBallConstraint`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SlidingBallConstraint) will limit the range of
translation. If true, this property exposes the
[`LowerLimit`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SlidingBallConstraint) and
[`UpperLimit`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SlidingBallConstraint) values, as well as
[`Restitution`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SlidingBallConstraint) which defines the elasticity of
the attachments when they reach either limit.
