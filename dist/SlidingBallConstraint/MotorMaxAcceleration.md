The constraint's maximum acceleration when
[`ActuatorType`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SlidingBallConstraint#ActuatorType) is set to
`Enum.ActuatorType|Motor`, as the constraint attempts to reach its desired
[`Velocity`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SlidingBallConstraint#Velocity).
