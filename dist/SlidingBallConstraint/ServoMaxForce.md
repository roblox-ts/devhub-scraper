The constraint's maximum force when
[`ActuatorType`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SlidingBallConstraint#ActuatorType) is set to
`Enum.ActuatorType|Servo`, as the constraint attempts to reach its desired
[`Speed`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SlidingBallConstraint#Speed).
