Positions and zooms the [`Workspace.CurrentCamera`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Workspace#CurrentCamera) to show the extent
of [`BasePart`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart)s currently in the [`Workspace`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Workspace).

This function was used in the, now removed, 'Zoom To Extents' button in
Roblox Studio. It exhibits similar behavior to the 'Zoom To' (F shortcut)
feature, however it shows the extents of the [`Workspace`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Workspace) rather than
the currently selected object.

This function cannot be used in scripts but will function in the command
bar or plugins.
