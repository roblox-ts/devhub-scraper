This property determines whether [parts](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BasePart) in different groups set to not collide will ignore collisions and touch events. By default, the value of this property is set to `false`.

When this property is enabled, parts in different groups et to not collide will also ignore the [CanTouch](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BasePart/CanTouch) property, similar to how [BasePart.CanCollide](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BasePart/CanCollide) is ignored. For more information on the behavior of CanTouch, please visit its property page.
