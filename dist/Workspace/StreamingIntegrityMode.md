If [`Workspace.StreamingEnabled`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Workspace#StreamingEnabled) is activated, an experience may
behave in unintended ways if a player's character moves into a region of
the world that has not been streamed to their client. The **Streaming
Integrity** feature offers a way to avoid those potentially problematic
situations. Please see the [`Enum.StreamingIntegrityMode`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/StreamingIntegrityMode) documentation and
the [Content Streaming](https://create.roblox.com/docs/workspace/streaming) article for more
details.
