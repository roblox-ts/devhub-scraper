With this property enabled, the physics engine computes aerodynamic forces
on [`BaseParts`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart) whose
[`EnableFluidForces`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#EnableFluidForces) property is true. The
default, `Enum.FluidForces|Default`, disables aerodynamic forces. Note
that this property cannot be set through scripting and instead must be
toggled in Studio.
