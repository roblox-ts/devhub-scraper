Determines the acceleration due to gravity applied to falling
[`BaseParts`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart). This value is measured in studs per second
squared and by default is set to 196.2 studs/second^2. By
changing this value, developers can simulate the effects of lower or
higher gravity in game.
