The **ThemeChanged** event fires when Studio's [Theme](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Studio/Theme) changes. The best use of this event is to get the colors from the theme that changed and update your plugin's UI accordingly.

See the `Articles/building studio widgets|Building Studio Widgets` tutorial for details on working with custom Studio widgets.
