Fires when the left mouse button is released.

For information on how to obtain the [`Mouse`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Mouse) object, please see the
[`Mouse`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Mouse) page.

Developers can find out the position of the mouse in world-space, and if
it is pointing at any [`BasePart`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart) using the [`Mouse.Hit`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Mouse#Hit) and
[`Mouse.Target`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Mouse#Target) properties.

Note, developers are recommended to use [`UserInputService`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UserInputService) instead
of the [`Mouse`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Mouse) object in new work.
