Fires when the left mouse button is released.

For information on how to obtain the [Mouse](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Mouse) object, please see the [Mouse](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Mouse) page.

Developers can find out the position of the mouse in world-space, and if it is pointing at any [BasePart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BasePart) using the [Mouse.Hit](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Mouse/Hit) and [Mouse.Target](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Mouse/Target) properties.

Note, developers are recommended to use [UserInputService](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/UserInputService) instead of the [Mouse](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Mouse) object in new work.
