The WheelBackward event fires when the mouse wheel is scrolled backwards. Possible uses for this event include toggling a gun's scope in a first person shooter (FPS) or zooming the player's camera.

This can be used alongside the scrolling forward event, [Mouse.WheelForward](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/Mouse/WheelForward).

For information on how to obtain the [Mouse](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Mouse) object, please see the [Mouse](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Mouse) page.

Note, developers are recommended to use [UserInputService](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/UserInputService) instead of the [Mouse](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Mouse) object in new work.
