This event fires when a Key is pressed, with the passed argument being the key that was pressed.

Notes
-----

*   Not all keys generate this event. However, you can get around this with a few of the keys, “/” for example, by using the [Mouse.KeyUp](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/Mouse/KeyUp) event.
*   Some keys generate the same string as other keys.
*   It's possible for the string to be empty (possibly due to “\\0” key code).
