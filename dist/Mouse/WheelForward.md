The WheelForward event fires when the mouse wheel is scrolled forwards.
Possible uses for this event include toggling a gun's scope in a first
person shooter (FPS) or zooming the player's camera.

This can be used alongside the scrolling backward event,
[`Mouse.WheelBackward`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Mouse#WheelBackward).

For information on how to obtain the [`Mouse`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Mouse) object, please see the
[`Mouse`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Mouse) page.

Note, developers are recommended to use [`UserInputService`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UserInputService) instead
of the [`Mouse`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Mouse) object in new work.
