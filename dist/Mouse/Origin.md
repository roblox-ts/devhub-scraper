The origin [`Mouse`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Mouse) property is a `Datatype.CFrame` indicating where
the mouse originated from. It is positioned at the
[`Workspace.CurrentCamera`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Workspace#CurrentCamera) and oriented toward the [`Mouse`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Mouse)'s 3D
position.

[`Mouse.UnitRay`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Mouse#UnitRay) starts at the same position as Origin, and extends
for a stud in the same direction.
```lua
local unitRay = mouse.UnitRay
local origin = mouse.Origin
-- unitRay.Direction = origin.p
-- unitRay.Direction â‰ˆ origin.lookVector
```

For the position of the [`Mouse`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Mouse) in 3D space, see [`Mouse.Hit`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Mouse#Hit).
