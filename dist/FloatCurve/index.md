An instance representing a 1D float curve encoded via a sorted list of [FloatCurveKeys](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/FloatCurveKey).

`FloatCurveKey` are value-time points that represent the changes in value over time. The changes of a single value over time are represented by a curve. Animators can edit keys to modify a curve. The shape of the curve is dictated by the [KeyInterpolationMode](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/enum/KeyInterpolationMode) chosen at each key.
