An instance representing a 1D float curve encoded via a sorted list of
[`FloatCurveKeys`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/datatypes/FloatCurveKey).

[`FloatCurveKeys`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/datatypes/FloatCurveKey) are value-time points that represent
the changes in value over time. The changes of a single value over time are
represented by a curve. Animators can edit keys to modify a curve. The shape
of the curve is dictated by the [`Enum.KeyInterpolationMode`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/KeyInterpolationMode) chosen at each
key.
