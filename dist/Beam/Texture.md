The content ID of the texture to be displayed on the [`Beam`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Beam).

If the Texture property of the beam is not set the beam will be displayed
as a solid line. This also occurs when the texture is set to an invalid
content ID or the image associated with the texture has not yet loaded.

The appearance of the texture can be further modified by other
[`Beam`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Beam) properties including [`Beam.Color`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Beam#Color) and
[`Beam.Transparency`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Beam#Transparency).

The scaling of the texture is determined by the [`Beam.TextureMode`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Beam#TextureMode),
[`Beam.TextureLength`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Beam#TextureLength), [`Beam.Width0`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Beam#Width0) and [`Beam.Width1`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Beam#Width1)
properties.
