The width in studs of the [`Beam`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Beam) at its base.

The beam will be Width0 studs wide at [`Beam.Attachment0`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Beam#Attachment0) and the
width will change linearly to [`Beam.Width1`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Beam#Width1) studs at
[`Beam.Attachment1`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Beam#Attachment1).

The width properties should not be confused with [`Beam.CurveSize0`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Beam#CurveSize0)
and [`Beam.CurveSize1`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Beam#CurveSize1) which control the curvature of the beam.
