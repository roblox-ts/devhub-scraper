Determines the speed at which the [Beam.Texture](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Beam/Texture) image moves along the [Beam](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Beam).

When TextureSpeed is positive, the beam's texture will move from [Beam.Attachment0](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Beam/Attachment0) to [Beam.Attachment1](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Beam/Attachment1). This direction can be inverted by setting TextureSpeed to a negative number.

Note the speed at which the texture moves is relative to the length of the texture. Meaning the more stretched the beam's [Beam.Texture](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Beam/Texture) is, the faster it will move at the same TextureSpeed.
