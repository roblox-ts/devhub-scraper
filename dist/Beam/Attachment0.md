The [Attachment](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Attachment) the [Beam](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Beam) originates from.

A [Beam](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Beam)'s Attachment0 is the first control point on the [Beam](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Beam)'s [cubic
BÃ©zier curve][1]. The orientation of Attachment0, alongside the [Beam](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Beam)'s
[Beam.CurveSize0](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Beam#CurveSize0), property determine the position of the second control
point.
