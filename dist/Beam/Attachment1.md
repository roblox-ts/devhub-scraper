The [`Attachment`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Attachment) the [`Beam`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Beam) ends at.

A [`Beam`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Beam)'s Attachment1 is the fourth and final control point on the
[`Beam`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Beam)'s [cubic BÃ©zier curve](https://create.roblox.com/docs/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve). The orientation of Attachment1,
alongside the [`Beam`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Beam)'s [`Beam.CurveSize1`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Beam#CurveSize1) property, determine
the position of the third control point.

For the [`Attachment`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Attachment) where the [`Beam`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Beam) starts see
[`Beam.Attachment0`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Beam#Attachment0).
