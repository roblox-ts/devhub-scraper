Scales the light emitted from [Beam](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Beam). By default, this property is 1 and
can set to any number within the range [0, 10000]. Increasing the value of
[LightInfluence](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Beam#LightInfluence) decreases the effect of
**Brightness**. **Brightness** doesn't have any effect when
[LightInfluence](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Beam#LightInfluence) is 1.
