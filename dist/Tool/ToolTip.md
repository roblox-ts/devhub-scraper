The ToolTip property controls the message that will be displayed when the player's [Mouse](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Mouse) hovers over the [Tool](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Tool) in their [Backpack](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Backpack).

Generally, the value of this property should describe the what the tool is or its use. For instance, for a shovel tool, you may choose to set the ToolTip to:

	tool.ToolTip = "Shovel"

or

	tool.ToolTip = "Use to dig"

or

	tool.ToolTip = "Shovel - Use to dig"
