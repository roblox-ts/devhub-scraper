The ToolTip property controls the message that will be displayed when the
player's [Mouse](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Mouse) hovers over the [Tool](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Tool) in their [Backpack](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Backpack).

Generally, the value of this property should describe the what the tool is
or its use. For instance, for a shovel tool, you may choose to set the
ToolTip to:

```lua
	tool.ToolTip = "Shovel"
```

or

```lua
	tool.ToolTip = "Use to dig"
```

or

```lua
	tool.ToolTip = "Shovel - Use to dig"
```
