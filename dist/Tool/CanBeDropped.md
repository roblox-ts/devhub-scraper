The CanBeDropped property controls whether the player can drop the [Tool](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Tool).

If true, when the backspace button is pressed the tool will be parented to
the [Workspace](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Workspace) and removed from the player's [Backpack](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Backpack). If false, the
when the backspace button is pressed the tool will go back to the player's
Backpack and it will not be dropped.
