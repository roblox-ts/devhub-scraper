The CanBeDropped property controls whether the player can drop the
[`Tool`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Tool).

If true, when the backspace button is pressed, the tool will be parented
to [`Workspace`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Workspace) and removed from the player's [`Backpack`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Backpack). If
false, nothing will happen when backspace is pressed, and the tool will
remain equipped.
