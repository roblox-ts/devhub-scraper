Tools are objects that a [Humanoid](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Humanoid) object can equip. For players, they are stored in a [Backpack](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Backpack) object parented to a [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player) object. In-game, players may have multiple tools which appear as icons at the bottom of the screen. Equipping a tool moves it from the Backpack and into a player's [character](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Character) model in the [Workspace](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Workspace). By default, tools are held in the right hand and have a handle in them, which is a [Part](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BasePart) named “Handle” inside (though one is not required if [Tool.RequiresHandle](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Tool/RequiresHandle) is off). Tools that are to be provided to (re)spawning players ought to be stored in the [StarterPack](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/StarterPack).

On desktop, pressing a number key (1, 2, 3…) will equip a tool. Equipped tools can be dropped into the Workspace by pressing Backspace. It's recommended that you turn [Tool.CanBeDropped](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Tool/CanBeDropped) off so it is not possible to drop a tool, die, respawn and drop again to duplicate tools. On gamepads, LB and RB buttons will equip tools. You can disable activation via left click (or right trigger on gamepad) by setting [Tool.ManualActivationOnly](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Tool/ManualActivationOnly) on. Doing so requires that you call Activate yourself through some sort of other user input.

Tools are not the only way to capture user input. You can also use [ContextActionService](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ContextActionService), [UserInputService](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/UserInputService) or [Player:GetMouse](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Player/GetMouse). If you need a Tool to have multiple actions, such as pressing a key while the Tool is equipped, you should use ContextActionService's [BindAction](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/ContextActionService/BindAction) and [UnbindAction](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/ContextActionService/UnbindAction) in the [Equipped](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/Tool/Equipped) and [Unequipped](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/Tool/Unequipped) events, respectively. Use a [LocalScript](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/LocalScript) send these actions to the server via a [RemoteFunction](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/RemoteFunction) inside the Tool.
