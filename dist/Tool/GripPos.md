The GripPos property controls the positional offset of a [Tool](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Tool) weld matrix. It is one of several properties used to position how the player holds the tool.

Other tool properties that control how a player holds a tool include: `Grip/GripUp|Up`, `Grip/GripRight|Right`, and `Grip/GripForward|Forward` properties. All of these properties are stored in a single CFrame in the [Tool.Grip](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Tool/Grip) property.

In order to change a tool's grip properties, you must either use a [Script](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Script) or [LocalScript](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/LocalScript) or a plugin such as [this](https://www.roblox.com/library/174577307/Tool-Grip-Editor-Plugin) one.
