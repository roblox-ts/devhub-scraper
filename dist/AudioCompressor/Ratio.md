Ratio of input volume to output volume, to be applied when surpassing
[`Threshold`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AudioCompressor#Threshold). For example, a value of 2
will cut the amount by which the input stream exceeds the threshold in
half whenever the input stream does so. Ranges from 1 to 50.
