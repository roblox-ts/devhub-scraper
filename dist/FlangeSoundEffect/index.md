The FlangeSoundEffect creates a sweeping or swooshing effect on the Sound or SoundGroup it is applied to. It does this by copying the original audio signal and playing on top of the original but slightly offset and modulated.  
  
Like all other [SoundEffect](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/SoundEffect), a FlangeSoundEffect can be applied either to a [Sound](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Sound) or [SoundGroup](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/SoundGroup) by being parented to either.
