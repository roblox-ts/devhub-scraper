The FlangeSoundEffect creates a sweeping or swooshing effect on the Sound or
SoundGroup it is applied to. It does this by copying the original audio signal
and playing on top of the original but slightly offset and modulated.

Like all other [SoundEffect](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SoundEffect), a FlangeSoundEffect can be applied either to a
[Sound](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Sound) or [SoundGroup](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SoundGroup) by being parented to either.
