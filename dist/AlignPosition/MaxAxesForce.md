Maximum force along each axis that the constraint can apply to achieve its
goal. Only used if [`RigidityEnabled`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignPosition#RigidityEnabled)
is false and [`ForceLimitMode`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignPosition#ForceLimitMode) is
[`PerAxis`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/ForceLimitMode). The axes used to apply to the limit are
specified using the [`ForceRelativeTo`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignPosition#ForceRelativeTo)
property.
