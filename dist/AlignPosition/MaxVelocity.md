Maximum speed the attachments can move when converging. Only used if
[`RigidityEnabled`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignPosition#RigidityEnabled) is false.

Note that [`MaxVelocity`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignPosition#MaxVelocity), as well as
[`MaxForce`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignPosition#MaxForce), are **caps** to the velocity and
force respectively. The actual scale is determined by
[`Responsiveness`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignPosition#Responsiveness).
