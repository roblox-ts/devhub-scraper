When false (default), force is applied to the parent of
[`Attachment0`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Constraint#Attachment0) at that attachment's location,
meaning that if the parent's center of mass is not aligned with the
direction of the force, torque will be applied as well as force. When
true, force is applied at the parents' center of mass.
