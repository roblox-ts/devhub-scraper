If true, the solver reacts as quickly as possible to complete the
alignment. If false, the torque is dependent on
[MaxForce](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignPosition#MaxForce),
[MaxVelocity](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignPosition#MaxVelocity), and
[Responsiveness](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignPosition#Responsiveness).
