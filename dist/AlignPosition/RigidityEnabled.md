Whether force is dependent on other properties, or if the physics solver
reacts as quickly as possible to complete the alignment. If false
(default), the force is determined by
[`MaxForce`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignPosition#MaxForce),
[`MaxVelocity`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignPosition#MaxVelocity), and
[`Responsiveness`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignPosition#Responsiveness). If true, the physics
solver reacts as quickly as possible to complete the alignment.
