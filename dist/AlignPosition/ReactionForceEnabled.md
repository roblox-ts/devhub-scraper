[`Attachment0`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Constraint#Attachment0) while
[`Attachment1`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Constraint#Attachment1) remains unaffected. If true,
the constraint applies force to both attachments in **equal and opposite
directions**.
