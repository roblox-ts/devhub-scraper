The FormFactorPart class is an abstract class. It inherits from the
[`BasePart`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart) class and adds the [`FormFactorPart.FormFactor`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/FormFactorPart#FormFactor) property
to classes that inherit from it.

The FormFactor property has been deprecated, so this class has been deprecated
as well.
