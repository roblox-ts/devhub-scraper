The ReflectionMetadataEnums is the class that acts as a [Folder](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Folder) for [ReflectionMetadataEnum](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ReflectionMetadataEnum) objects.

Since it is an internal object, it cannot be used by developers.
