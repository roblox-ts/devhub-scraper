The ReflectionMetadataEnums is the class that acts as a [Folder](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Folder) for
[ReflectionMetadataEnum](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ReflectionMetadataEnum) objects.

Since it is an internal object, it cannot be used by developers.
