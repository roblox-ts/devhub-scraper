[`AudioReverb`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AudioReverb) reverberates audio streams, modeling the natural echoes of
a room or enclosed space. It provides one **Input** pin and one **Output** pin
which can be connected to/from by [`Wires`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Wire).
