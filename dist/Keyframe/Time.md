This property gives the [Keyframe](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Keyframe)'s time position (in seconds) in an
animation. This determines the time at which the [Pose](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Pose)s inside the
keyframe will be shown.

Note the [Keyframe](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Keyframe) with the highest time value in a [KeyframeSequence](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/KeyframeSequence) is
used to determine the length of the animation.
