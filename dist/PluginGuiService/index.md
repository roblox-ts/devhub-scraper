PluginGuiService is a service that stores [PluginGui](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PluginGui) objects to be displayed
in Roblox Studio. It only allows PluginGuis to be direct children of the
service, and PluginGuis are not allowed to be parented anywhere besides the
service.
