PluginGuiService is a service that stores [PluginGui](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/PluginGui) objects to be displayed in Roblox Studio. It only allows PluginGuis to be direct children of the service, and PluginGuis are not allowed to be parented anywhere besides the service.
