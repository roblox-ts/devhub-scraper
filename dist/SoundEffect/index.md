SoundEffect is the base class that all other sound effects derive from. A SoundEffect can be applied to either a [Sound](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Sound) or [SoundGroup](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/SoundGroup) by being parented to either.  
  
Multiple effects can be applied to the same Sound or SoundGroup. The order the effects will be applied in is determined by that effect's Priority.
