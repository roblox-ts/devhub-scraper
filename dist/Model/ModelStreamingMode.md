Controls how [`Model`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Model) instances are streamed in and out when
streaming is enabled. Behavior depends on selected enum. Has no effect
when experience is not streaming enabled.

Should only be changed in Studio and in [`Scripts`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Script), never in
[`LocalScripts`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/LocalScript) (doing so can result in undefined
behavior).

For details on the various streaming modes and their effects, see
[Content Streaming](https://create.roblox.com/docs/workspace/streaming) for more details.
