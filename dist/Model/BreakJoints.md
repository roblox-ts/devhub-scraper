Breaks connections between `BaseParts`, including surface connections with any adjacent parts, [WeldConstraint](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/WeldConstraint)s, and all [Weld](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Weld)s and other [JointInstance](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/JointInstance)s.

When BreakJoints is used on a Player character [Model](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Model), the character's [Humanoid](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Humanoid) will die as it relies on the Neck joint.

Note that although joints produced by surface connections with adjacent Parts can technically be recreated using [Model:MakeJoints](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Model/MakeJoints), this will only recreate joints produced by surfaces. Developers should not rely on this as following the joints being broken parts may no longer be in contact with each other.
