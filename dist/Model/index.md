Models are container objects, meaning they group objects together. They are best used to hold collections of [BaseParts](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BasePart) and have a number of functions that extend their functionality.

Models are intended to represent **geometric** groupings. If your grouping has no geometric interpretation, for instance a collection of [Scripts](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Script), use a [Folder](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Folder) instead.

Models whose constituent parts are joined together with joints (so that they can move around or be destroyed via physics simulation) usually have a [PrimaryPart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Model/PrimaryPart) set, as it specifies which part within the model the pivot and bounding box will “follow” as the model moves. Static models which stay in one place do not benefit from having a primary part set.

Models have a wide range of applications, including Roblox player characters. They also have a number of unique behaviors that are important to keep in mind:

*   When a [Humanoid](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Humanoid) and a [Part](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Part) named **Head** are parented under a model, a name/health GUI will appear over the model; see [Character Name/Health Display](https://developer.roblox.com/articles/character-name-health-display) for details.
*   If a part's position on the **Y** axis hits the [Workspace.FallenPartsDestroyHeight](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Workspace/FallenPartsDestroyHeight) value, and it was the last object inside of a [Model](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Model), the model will be destroyed as well.
