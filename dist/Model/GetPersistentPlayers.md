When this method is called from a [`Script`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Script), it returns all the
[`Player`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player) objects that this model is persistent for. When called from
a [`LocalScript`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/LocalScript), this method only checks if this model is persistent
for the [`LocalPlayer`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Players#LocalPlayer).
