Sets the level of detail on the model for experiences with content
[streaming](https://create.roblox.com/docs/workspace/streaming) enabled.

When set to `Enum.ModelLevelOfDetail|StreamingMesh`, a lower resolution
"imposter" mesh (colored, coarse mesh that wraps around all child parts of
the model) renders outside the streaming radius.

When set to `Enum.ModelLevelOfDetail|Disabled` or
`Enum.ModelLevelOfDetail|Automatic`, lower resolution meshes will not be
displayed.
