Sets the level of detail on the model for experiences with content
[streaming](https://create.roblox.com/docs/workspace/streaming) enabled.

When set to [`StreamingMesh`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/ModelLevelOfDetail), a lower resolution
"imposter" mesh (colored, coarse mesh that wraps around all child parts of
the model) renders outside the streaming radius.

When set to [`Disabled`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/ModelLevelOfDetail) or
[`Automatic`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/ModelLevelOfDetail), lower resolution meshes will not be
displayed.

for further details.
