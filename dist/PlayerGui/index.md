The PlayerGui object is a container that holds a [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player)'s user GUI. If a [ScreenGui](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ScreenGui) is a descendant of a PlayerGui, then any [GuiObject](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/GuiObject) inside of the ScreenGui will be drawn to the player's screen. Any [LocalScript](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/LocalScript) will run as soon as it is inserted into a PlayerGui.

When a player first joins a game, their PlayerGui is automatically inserted into their [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player) object. When the player's [Player.Character](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Player/Character) spawns for the first time all of the contents of [StarterGui](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/StarterGui) are automatically copied into the player's PlayerGui. Note that if [Players.CharacterAutoLoads](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Players/CharacterAutoLoads) is set to false the character will not spawn and StarterGui contents will not be copied until [Player:LoadCharacter](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Player/LoadCharacter) is called. If [StarterGui.ResetPlayerGuiOnSpawn](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/StarterGui/ResetPlayerGuiOnSpawn) is set to true then every time the player's character respawns all of the contents of that player's PlayerGui is cleared and replaced with the contents of StarterGui.
