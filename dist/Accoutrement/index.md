An Accoutrement is an object that welds its child [part](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Part) called “Handle” to the Head of a player's character. The position and rotation of the Handle part can be changed with the [AttachmentPos](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Accoutrement/AttachmentPos)/[Right](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Accoutrement/AttachmentRight)/[Forward](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Accoutrement/AttachmentForward)/[Up](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Accoutrement/AttachmentUp) properties.

Parts descending from an accoutrement will be massless when attached to other parts (e.g. with a Weld) as long as they are not the root part of the assembly returned by [GetRootPart()](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/BasePart/GetRootPart). [GetMass()](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/BasePart/GetMass) will return 0 for parts in this case and it will not add to the total mass or rotational inertia of the Assembly.

This will not apply to a part descending from an accoutrement when an accoutrement is not welded to another part that is _**not**_ massless or one if its parts otherwise becomes root. This will not apply for the root part, it will have mass like a normal part.
