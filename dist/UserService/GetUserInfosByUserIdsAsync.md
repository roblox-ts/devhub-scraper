This function enables developers to request information about users outside of the current [Datamodel](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/DataModel) in bulk, which is why both the input and output values are arrays.

*   The order of the `UserInfosResponse` objects in the return value's array may not match the order of the `UserIds` sent in the input parameter's array. Use the `Id` field of the `UserInfosResponse` object to identify your input array with the output array.
*   It's possible to receive less `UserInfoResponse` objects than requested if one or more of the `userIds` in the request array are invalid, such as negative numbers or user ID's that don't have accounts associated with them. It's possible to receive a response with zero results if all userIds are invalid.
*   If a Roblox user does not have a display name associated with their account, the function will return instead the same string as the user's username in the `DisplayName` field. See [Player.DisplayName](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Player/DisplayName). While a user's UserId will never change, a user may change their username or display name. The same input `UserIds` may return a different string for these fields from one day to another.
*   Since `GetUserInfosByUserIdsAsync()` makes an external web request, it will yield and may fail if the backend service is experiencing interruptions. Ensure you can handle downtime appropriately by wrapping the method with a pcall.
