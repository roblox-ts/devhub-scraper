Using MaterialVariant objects can expand the variety of materials in an
experience. MaterialVariant has properties that can define the appearance of a
material. Its name can be set in MaterialService to globally override a
built-in material, or set in the [`BasePart.MaterialVariant`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#MaterialVariant) property to
change certain Parts. MaterialVariant objects only work as descendants of
MaterialService.
