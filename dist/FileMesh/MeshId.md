The MeshId is the content ID of the mesh that is to be displayed.

The content ID for a mesh is generated when a developer uploads a mesh to
the Roblox website.

#### How do I create a mesh?

Meshes can currently only be be uploaded using [MeshPart](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/MeshPart)s or the game
explorer. Once uploaded however, the content ID for the mesh can be used
for the MeshId property. For more information, see
[Meshes](/building-and-visuals/modeling/meshes).
