The MeshId is the content ID of the mesh that is to be displayed.

The content ID for a mesh is generated when a developer uploads a mesh to the Roblox website.

How do I create a mesh?
-----------------------

Meshes can currently only be be uploaded using [MeshPart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/MeshPart)s or the game explorer. Once uploaded however, the content ID for the mesh can be used for the MeshId property. For more information on how to do this please see `Articles/Mesh Parts|this tutorial`.
