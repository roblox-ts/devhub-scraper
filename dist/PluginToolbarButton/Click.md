**Click** fires when the PluginToolbarButton is pressed and released by the user.

Clicking a PluginToolbarButton causes the state of the button to toggle. Call [SetActive](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/PluginToolbarButton/SetActive) to manually set the state of the button.
