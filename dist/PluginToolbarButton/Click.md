**Click** fires when the PluginToolbarButton is pressed and released by
the user.

Clicking a PluginToolbarButton causes the state of the button to toggle.
Call [`SetActive`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PluginToolbarButton#SetActive) to manually set the
state of the button.
