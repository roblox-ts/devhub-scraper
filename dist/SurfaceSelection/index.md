A **SurfaceSelection** highlights a particular face, the
[`TargetSurface`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SurfaceSelection#TargetSurface), of its
[`Adornee`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PartAdornment#Adornee). The highlight's color is configurable
using the [`Color3`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiBase3d#Color3) property.

The SurfaceSelection object is typically used by [`Plugin`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Plugin) when the user
is selecting the face of a Part. However, it is not limited to plugin use.
