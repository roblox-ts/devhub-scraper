A **SurfaceSelection** highlights a particular face, the [TargetSurface](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/SurfaceSelection/TargetSurface), of its [Adornee](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/PartAdornment/Adornee). The highlight's color is configurable using the [Color3](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/GuiBase3d/Color3) property.

The SurfaceSelection object is typically used by [Plugin](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Plugin) when the user is selecting the face of a Part. However, it is not limited to plugin use.
