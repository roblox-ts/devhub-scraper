Returns a new [HumanoidDescription](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/HumanoidDescription) with the Shirt and Pants properties updated if necessary. Returns nil if default clothing was not needed.

Default clothing is necessary if the HumanoidDescription does not currently have Shirt and Pants equipped and the body colors are too similar.
