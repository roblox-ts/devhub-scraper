Returns a new [`HumanoidDescription`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HumanoidDescription) with the Shirt and Pants
properties updated if necessary. Returns nil if default clothing was not
needed.

Default clothing is necessary if the HumanoidDescription does not
currently have Shirt and Pants equipped and the body colors are too
similar.
