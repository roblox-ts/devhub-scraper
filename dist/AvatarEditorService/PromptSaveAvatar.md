This function prompts the [`Players.LocalPlayer`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Players#LocalPlayer) to update their
avatar based on the given [`HumanoidDescription`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HumanoidDescription) and [`Enum.RigType`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/RigType)
(R6 or R15). Does not yield and can get the result by listening to the
PromptSaveAvatarCompleted event. This is similar to how other prompts such
as PromptPurchase work.
