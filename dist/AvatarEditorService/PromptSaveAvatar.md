This function prompts the [Players.LocalPlayer](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Players/LocalPlayer) to update their avatar based on the given [HumanoidDescription](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/HumanoidDescription) and [RigType](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/enum/RigType) (R6 or R15). Does not yield and can get the result by listening to the PromptSaveAvatarCompleted event. This is similar to how other prompts such as PromptPurchase work.
