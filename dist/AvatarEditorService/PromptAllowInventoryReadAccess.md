Prompts the [`Players.LocalPlayer`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Players#LocalPlayer) to allow the developer to read
what items the user has in their inventory and other avatar editor related
information. The prompt needs to be confirmed by the user for the
developer to use [`AvatarEditorService:GetInventory()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AvatarEditorService#GetInventory),
[`AvatarEditorService:GetOutfits()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AvatarEditorService#GetOutfits) and
[`AvatarEditorService:GetFavorite()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AvatarEditorService#GetFavorite). Permission does not persist
between sessions.
