This function prompts the [Players.LocalPlayer](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Players/LocalPlayer) to allow the developer to read what items the user has in their inventory and other avatar editor related information. The prompt needs to be confirmed by the user for the developer to use [AvatarEditorService:GetInventory](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/AvatarEditorService/GetInventory), [AvatarEditorService:GetOutfits](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/AvatarEditorService/GetOutfits) and [AvatarEditorService:GetFavorite](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/AvatarEditorService/GetFavorite). This would have to be requested once per session but in the future we may wish to save this permission per game.
