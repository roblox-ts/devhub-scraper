The TremoloSoundEffect creates a trembling effect on a sound by varying the volume of the sound up and down.

Like all other [SoundEffect](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/SoundEffect)s, a TremoloSoundEffect can be applied either to a [Sound](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Sound) or [SoundGroup](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/SoundGroup) by being parented to either.
