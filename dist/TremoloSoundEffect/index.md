The TremoloSoundEffect creates a trembling effect on a sound by varying the
volume of the sound up and down.

Like all other [`SoundEffect`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SoundEffect)s, a TremoloSoundEffect can be applied
either to a [`Sound`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Sound) or [`SoundGroup`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SoundGroup) by being parented to either.
