GetKeyframeSequenceAsync returns a [KeyframeSequence](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/KeyframeSequence) based on the specified assetId. The assetId must correspond to an animation. The function will yield until the [KeyframeSequence](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/KeyframeSequence) is loaded from the website. Because this is a webcall it should wrapped in a pcall.
