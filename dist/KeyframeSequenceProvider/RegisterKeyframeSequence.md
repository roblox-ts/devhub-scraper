Generates a temporary asset ID from a [`KeyframeSequence`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/KeyframeSequence) that can be
used for localized testing of an animation.

This function performs the same function to
[`KeyframeSequenceProvider:RegisterActiveKeyframeSequence()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/KeyframeSequenceProvider#RegisterActiveKeyframeSequence) however
this function generates a hash instead of an *active://* URL.

The ID generated can be used for the [`Animation.AnimationId`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Animation#AnimationId)
property to test animations.

The asset ID generated by this function is temporary and cannot be used
outside of Studio. Developers wishing to generate an asset ID that can be
used online should upload the [`KeyframeSequence`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/KeyframeSequence) to Roblox.
