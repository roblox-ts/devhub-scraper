**RunService** contains methods and events for time-management as well as for managing the context in which a game or script is running. Methods like [IsClient](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/RunService/IsClient), [IsServer](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/RunService/IsServer), [IsStudio](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/RunService/IsStudio), can help you determine under what context code is running. These methods are useful for ModuleScripts that may be required by both client and server scripts. Furthermore, [IsStudio](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/RunService/IsStudio) can be used to add special behaviors for in-studio testing.

RunService also houses events that allow your code to adhere to Roblox's frame-by-frame loop, such as [Stepped](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/RunService/Stepped), [Heartbeat](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/RunService/Heartbeat) and [RenderStepped](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/RunService/RenderStepped). Selecting the proper event to use for any case is important, so you should read [Task Scheduler](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Task-Scheduler) to make an informed decision.
