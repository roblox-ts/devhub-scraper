This function pauses the games' simulation if it is running, suspending physics and scripts.

The simulation can be started using [RunService:Run](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/RunService/Run) or the 'Run' button in Roblox Studio. When the simulation is paused, [RunService:IsRunning](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/RunService/IsRunning) will return _false_.

Pausing the simulation can be used to assist with debugging in Roblox Studio, it cannot be used in real game sessions.
