A UIListLayout lays out sibling UI elements in a single row within the parent UI element, either horizontally or vertically. Each sibling UI element retains its original [GuiObject.Size](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/GuiObject/Size), but its [GuiObject.Position](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/GuiObject/Position) will be taken under control by the UIListLayout. While under control, the Position property of sibling UI elements will not be editable in the Properties window.

You can use the elements' [GuiObject.LayoutOrder](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/GuiObject/LayoutOrder) by changing `UIListLayout/SortOrder` to LayoutOrder. A UIListLayout will automatically re-layout elements when elements are added/removed, or if a relevant property changes: [GuiObject.LayoutOrder](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/GuiObject/LayoutOrder), [Instance.Name](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Instance/Name) or [GuiObject.Size](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/GuiObject/Size). This can be triggered manually by calling [UIGridStyleLayout:ApplyLayout](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/UIGridStyleLayout/ApplyLayout), though this is typically not necessary.

Since each property that changes how elements are laid out will re-apply the layout, it is recommended to set the [Instance.Parent](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Instance/Parent) property last so that the layout is only applied once. Similarly, since adding more UI elements will also re-apply the layout, add the UIListLayout last so it does not recalculate positions after each element.
