The Sky object is an object, when placed inside [Lighting](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Lighting), will change the
appearance of the game's sky. This allows for a custom sky to be used as
opposed to the Roblox default sky. The Skybox is composed of six sides, much
like that of a cube. If the skybox is changed/customised, the Sun and other
objects in the sky will remain visible, unless you turn off the Sky object's
[Sky.CelestialBodiesShown](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Sky#CelestialBodiesShown) property, which will remove the Sun, Moon, and
stars from the sky. The recommended picture dimensions for a Skybox side are
256x256 pixels. By adjusting the [Sky.StarCount](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Sky#StarCount) property of the Sky object,
you can change how many stars will appear in the sky at night.
