For handles to be interactive, they must be parented to a player's [PlayerGui](PlayerGui) or the [CoreGui](CoreGui).

The **ArcHandles** object places 3D ArcHandles around any object that its [PartAdornment.Adornee](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/PartAdornment/Adornee) is set to. The Adornee property must be set to a 3D object for the handles to appear. The [Color](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/GuiBase3d/Color3) can be changed.
