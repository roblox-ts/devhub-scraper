The **ArcHandles** object places 3D arc handles around any 3D object that its
[`Adornee`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PartAdornment#Adornee) is set to. For handles to be
interactive, it must be parented to a player's [`PlayerGui`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PlayerGui) or the
[`CoreGui`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/CoreGui).
