For handles to be interactive, they must be parented to a player's [PlayerGui](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PlayerGui)
or the [CoreGui](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/CoreGui). The [ArcHandles](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ArcHandles) object places 3D ArcHandles around any
object that its [PartAdornment.Adornee](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PartAdornment#Adornee) is set to. The Adornee property must
be set to a 3D object for the handles to appear. The [Color](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiBase3d#Color3)
can be changed.
