The Shape property sets the overall shape of the object to one of a
predetermined list of built-in shapes.

The `Enum.PartType` enum controls the shape value, and has five possible
shapes:

| Shape/Value | Description |
| - | - |
| Ball | A spherical shape, like a basketball. |
| Cylinder | A rod-like shape, like a tin can. |
| Block | The default, brick shape. |
| Wedge | A wedge shape with a slope on one side. |
| CornerWedge | A wedge shape with slopes on two sides. |

Note that [`MeshPart`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/MeshPart) and
[solid modeling](https://create.roblox.com/docs/parts/solid-modeling) can be used to obtain
completely custom part shapes.
