The Shape property sets the type of shape the object has.

The [PartType](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/enum/PartType) enum controls the shape value, and has three possible
shapes:

| Shape/Value | Description                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Ball        | A spherical shape, like a basketball. |
| Cylinder    | A rod-like shape, like a tin can.     |
| Block       | The default, brick shape.             |

To obtain custom part shapes, you can use a [MeshPart](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/MeshPart) instead of a
[Part](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Part).
