The Shape property sets the type of shape the object has.

The [PartType](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/enum/PartType) enum controls the shape value, and has three possible shapes:

Shape/Value

Description

Ball

A spherical shape, like a basketball.

Cylinder

A rod-like shape, like a tin can.

Block

The default, brick shape.

To obtain custom part shapes, you can use a [MeshPart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/MeshPart) instead of a [Part](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Part).
