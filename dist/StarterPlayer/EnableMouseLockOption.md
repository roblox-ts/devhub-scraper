The EnableMouseLockOption [StarterPlayer](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/StarterPlayer) property determines if a player
can toggle mouse lock by default.

Mouselock will lock the player's cursor to the center of the screen.
Moving the mouse will rotate the [Camera](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Camera) and [Player](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player) will move relative
to the current rotation of the camera.

This property sets the value of [Player.DevEnableMouseLock](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player#DevEnableMouseLock).
