The CameraMinZoonDistance [StarterPlayer](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/StarterPlayer) property sets the minimum
distance in studs the camera can be from the character with the default
cameras.

This property sets the default value of [Player.CameraMinZoomDistance](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player#CameraMinZoomDistance) for
each player who joins the game. If this value is set to a higher value
than [StarterPlayer.CameraMaxZoomDistance](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/StarterPlayer#CameraMaxZoomDistance) it will be decreased to
CameraMaxZoomDistance.
