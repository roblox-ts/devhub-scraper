The NameDisplayDistance [StarterPlayer](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/StarterPlayer) property sets the distance in studs at which this player will see other [Humanoid](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Humanoid)'s names. If set to 0, names are hidden. This property is set to 100 studs by default.

To change the display distance for a player once they join the game, you can set the [Player.NameDisplayDistance](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Player/NameDisplayDistance) property.

Note
----

If a Humanoid's name is visible, you can set the display type using [Humanoid.DisplayDistanceType](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Humanoid/DisplayDistanceType).
