Sets the distance at which this player will see other Humanoid's names. If
set to 0, names are hidden.

The NameDisplayDistance [`StarterPlayer`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/StarterPlayer) property sets the distance
in studs at which this player will see other [`Humanoid`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid)'s names. If
set to 0, names are hidden. This property is set to 100 studs by default.

To change the display distance for a player once they join the game, you
can set the [`Player.NameDisplayDistance`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player#NameDisplayDistance) property.

If a Humanoid's name is visible, you can set the display type using
[`Humanoid.DisplayDistanceType`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid#DisplayDistanceType).
