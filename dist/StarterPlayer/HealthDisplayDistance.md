The HealthDisplayDistance [StarterPlayer](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/StarterPlayer) property sets the distance in
studs at which this player will see other [Humanoid](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid)'s health bars. If set
to 0, the health bars will not be displayed. This property is set to 100
studs by default.

To change the display distance for a player once they join the game, you
can set the [Player.HealthDisplayDistance](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player#HealthDisplayDistance) property.

#### Note

If a Humanoid's health bar is visible, you can set the display type using
[Humanoid.DisplayDistanceType](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid#DisplayDistanceType).
