The CameraMaxZoomDistance [`StarterPlayer`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/StarterPlayer) property sets the maximum
distance in studs the camera can be from the character with the default
cameras.

This property sets the default value of
[`Player.CameraMaxZoomDistance`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player#CameraMaxZoomDistance) for each player who joins the game.
If this value is set to a lower value than
[`StarterPlayer.CameraMinZoomDistance`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/StarterPlayer#CameraMinZoomDistance) it will be increased to
CameraMinZoomDistance.
