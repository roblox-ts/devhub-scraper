This property determines if user-owned emotes are loaded when loading
avatars. Setting this property to false disables loading. Developers can
set the property in Studio directly or through the
[Game Settings menu](/studio/game-settings).

When emote loading is disabled, the emotes UI will still work as long as
developers choose to use the emotes feature by adding emotes within their
game.
