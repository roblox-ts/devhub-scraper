This property can only be set in Studio and cannot be set by scripts at runtime, although it can be read by scripts.

This property determines if user-owned emotes are loaded when loading avatars. Setting this property to false disables loading. Developers can set the property in Studio directly or through the [Game Settings UI](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Game-Settings).

When emote loading is disabled, the emotes UI will still work as long as developers choose to use the emotes feature by adding emotes within their game.
