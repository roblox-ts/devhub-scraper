Setting this property to false would disable loading of emotes that users own when loading avatars. Developers could set the property in Studio directly or through the Game Settings UI.

When emote loading is disabled the emotes UI would still work if the developer chooses to use the emotes feature by adding emotes within their game.

The property would be Standard security and would serialize in the place file.
