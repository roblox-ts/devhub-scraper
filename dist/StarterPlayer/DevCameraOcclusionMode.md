The DevCameraOcclusionMode [StarterPlayer](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/StarterPlayer) property sets how the default camera handles objects between the camera and the player.

This is the default property for players joining the game. It can be changed for individual players by settings the `Player/DevComputerOcclusionMode`.

The default value is _Zoom_ (0): The camera will zoom in until there is nothing between the player and camera.
