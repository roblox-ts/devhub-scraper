The AutoJumpEnabled property sets whether the character will automatically jump when hitting an obstacle on a mobile device.

This property is copied from the [StarterPlayer](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/StarterPlayer) to a [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player) when they join the game. Following that. the value of this property is copied to [Humanoid.AutoJumpEnabled](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Humanoid/AutoJumpEnabled) property of the [Player.Character](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Player/Character)s [Humanoid](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Humanoid) on spawn. In other words, it is possible to set the auto-jump behavior on a per-character, per-player and per-game basis using these three properties.
