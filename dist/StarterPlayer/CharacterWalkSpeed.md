**CharacterWalkSpeed** determines the starting value of
[Humanoid.WalkSpeed](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid#WalkSpeed) for a [Player](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player)'s [Character](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player#Character). This
property defaults to 16.

Since this property is only relevant for characters being spawned in the
future, changing it will not change any existing player characters.
Changes to this property will only take effect when a player respawns.
