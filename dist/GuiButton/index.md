GuiLabel is an abstract class that inherits from [GuiObject](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/GuiObject). It is the base class for [ImageButton](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ImageButton) and [TextButton](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/TextButton). Objects of this type serve to be interactive, clickable user interface elements. It defines several properties for interaction behavior, namely [GuiButton.AutoButtonColor](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/GuiButton/AutoButtonColor) and [GuiButton.Modal](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/GuiButton/Modal), as well as a handful of events for mouse buttons ([GuiButton.MouseButton1Click](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/GuiButton/MouseButton1Click), [GuiButton.MouseButton1Down](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/GuiButton/MouseButton1Down), etc).

The most import ant event of a GuiButton is [GuiButton.Activated](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/GuiButton/Activated), a **multi-platform event** that fires when the button is activated. When using a mouse, this means clicking the button and releasing with the cursor still over the UI object. For touch, the same applies but with a touch instead of button press. Finally, for gamepads, [GuiButton.Activated](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/GuiButton/Activated) fires if a GuiButton is selected when the A-button is pressed and released. In short, this event is very useful for multi-platform user interface programming as it provides a nice general interface for a single user input.
