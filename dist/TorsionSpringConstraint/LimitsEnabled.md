This property, when enabled, limits the relative angular motion of the
secondary axes of attachments through a cone constraint. The default value
is false.

In the example below, you can enable a cone limit on the relative motion
of the secondary axes as follows:

```lua
torsionSpring.LimitEnabled = true
```
