In the absence of damping, this property is proportional to the opposing
torque of the spring. For instance, higher stiffness results in a larger
opposing torque, and smaller stiffness results in a smaller opposing
torque. The larger the torque value, the faster the axes are pushed
together when the relative angle is positive (or away from each other if
the relative angle is negative). The value defaults to 100.
