This property indicates the current angle, in degrees, of the [TorsionSpringConstraint's](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/TorsionSpringConstraint) limiting cone. The limiting cone is formed at the position of the constraint's [Attachment0](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Constraint/Attachment0) around its secondary axis with an angle equal to [MaxAngle](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/TorsionSpringConstraint/MaxAngle).
