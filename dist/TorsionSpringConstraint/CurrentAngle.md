The current angle, in degrees, of the
[TorsionSpringConstraint's](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TorsionSpringConstraint) limiting cone. The
limiting cone is formed at the position of the constraint's
[Attachment0](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Constraint#Attachment0) around its secondary axis with an
angle equal to [MaxAngle](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TorsionSpringConstraint#MaxAngle).
