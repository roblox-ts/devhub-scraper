The current angle, in degrees, of the torsion spring's limiting cone. The
limiting cone is formed at the position of the constraint's
[`Attachment0`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Constraint#Attachment0) around its secondary axis with
an angle equal to [`MaxAngle`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TorsionSpringConstraint#MaxAngle).
