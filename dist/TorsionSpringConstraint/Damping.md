Damping constant for the [`TorsionSpringConstraint`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TorsionSpringConstraint). Multiplied to
the velocity of the constraint's [`Attachments`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Attachment) to reduce
the spring force applied.
