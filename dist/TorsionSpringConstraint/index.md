A torsion spring applies a torque based on a relative angle and a relative angular velocity. Specifically, torsion springs try to bring two axes from two parts together in a compliance way.

This constraint is ideal for building vehicle suspension as demonstrated in [Building a Basic Car](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/building-carkit-1).
