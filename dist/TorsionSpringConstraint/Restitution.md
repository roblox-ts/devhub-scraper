This property defines how elastic [`Attachments`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Attachment) connected
by a [`TorsionSpringConstraint`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TorsionSpringConstraint) are when they reach the end of the
range specified by [`MaxAngle`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TorsionSpringConstraint#MaxAngle), when
[`LimitEnabled`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TorsionSpringConstraint#LimitEnabled) is true. The
value defaults to 0 and can be any floating number within the range of 0
and 1.
