For handles to be interactive, they must be parented to a player's PlayerGui or the CoreGui.

The **Handles** object places 3D handles around any object that its Adornee is set to. The Adornee property must be set to a 3D object for the handles to appear. The color can be changed, and the shape of the handles can be set to either arrows or spheres.
