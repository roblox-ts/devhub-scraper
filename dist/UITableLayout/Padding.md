Padding will position elements with extra space between them. This can be
done using Scale or Offset components of UDim2. Negative values can bring
elements closer together. When non-zero, the sibling UI elements may be
visible between the cells contained within them. In the image below, you
can see the padding of 5 pixels applied between the cells (and the sibling
UI elements acting as rows in yellow).
