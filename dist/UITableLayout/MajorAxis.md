MajorAxis determines whether sibling UI elements are treated as rows or
columns. Below, the left uses a `Enum.TableMajorAxis` of RowMajor, and the
right uses ColumnMajor.

**Note: it seems that this property isn't making noticeable changes, and
rather its behavior is determined by
[`UIGridStyleLayout.FillDirection`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UIGridStyleLayout#FillDirection) instead.**
