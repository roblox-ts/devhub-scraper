MajorAxis determines whether sibling UI elements are treated as rows or columns. Below, the left uses a [TableMajorAxis](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/enum/TableMajorAxis) of RowMajor, and the right uses ColumnMajor.

**Note: it seems that this property isn't making noticeable changes, and rather its behavior is determined by [UIGridStyleLayout.FillDirection](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/UIGridStyleLayout/FillDirection) instead.**
