FillEmptySpaceRows determines whether cells' Y size are set such that the entire vertical space of the parent UI element is used. Enabling this is useful for making sure your table takes up a more easily predictable amount of vertical space (the Y-axis size of the parent UI element). It is still possible that a [UISizeConstraint](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/UISizeConstraint) applied to cells will cause underflow/overflow.

When enabling this property, the row heights will be approximately equal to the parent's [GuiBase2d.AbsoluteSize](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/GuiBase2d/AbsoluteSize).Y component divided by the number of rows (not accounting for padding or other factors).
