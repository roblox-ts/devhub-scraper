**Note** This property functions identically to [Sparkles.Color](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Sparkles/Color)

The SparkleColor property determines the color of all the particles emit by a [Sparkles](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Sparkles) object (both existing and future particles). It behaves similarly to [ParticleEmitter.Color](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/ParticleEmitter/Color), except that it is only one color and not a [ColorSequence](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/datatype/ColorSequence). Sparkles have a natural color sequence applied which is most apparent when this property is set to white; sparkles very faintly animate between a subtle green and red.

It should be noted that sparkles have a partial [ParticleEmitter.LightEmission](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/ParticleEmitter/LightEmission) effect, so dark colors tend to render more transparent and white colors look very bright.
