Modern controllers have motors built in to provide haptic feedback. Adding
rumbles and vibrations can greatly enhance a game's experience and provide
subtle feedback that is hard to convey through visuals or audio.

We support haptics for the following devices:

- Android and iOS phones supporting haptics including most iPhone, Pixel, and
Samsung Galaxy devices
- Playstation gamepads
- Quest Touch controller
- Xbox gamepads
