The **SunRaysEffect** renders a halo of light around sun. The halo is
shaped/blocked by world objects between the [Workspace.CurrentCamera](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Workspace#CurrentCamera) and the
sun.

Like other post-processing effects, **SunRaysEffect** will only work while
[Enabled](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PostEffect#Enabled) and when parented to [Lighting](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Lighting) or
[Workspace.CurrentCamera](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Workspace#CurrentCamera). Also, it may not render on low-end devices, and it
may render differently depending on your Studio settings (see the **Quality
Level** settings in **Rendering** â†’ **Performance**).
