The **SunRaysEffect** renders a halo of light around sun. The halo is shaped/blocked by world objects between the [Workspace.CurrentCamera](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Workspace/CurrentCamera) and the sun.

Like other post-processing effects, **SunRaysEffect** will only work while [Enabled](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/PostEffect/Enabled) and when parented to [Lighting](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Lighting) or [Workspace.CurrentCamera](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Workspace/CurrentCamera). Also, it may not render on low-end devices, and it may render differently depending on your Studio settings (see the **Quality Level** settings in **Rendering** → **Performance**).

For more details on this effect and others, see the [Post-Processing Effects](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/post-processing-effects) article.
