[`VideoFrame.Video`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/VideoFrame#Video) is playing.

As [`VideoFrame.TimePosition`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/VideoFrame#TimePosition) is not reset, when the video is resumed
it will continue from its previous position.
