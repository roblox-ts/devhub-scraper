The Color property determines the color of a part. If the part has a
[BasePart.Material](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#Material), this also determines the color used when rendering
the material texture. If this property is set, [BasePart.BrickColor](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#BrickColor) will
use the closest BrickColor to the Color3 value.

Other visual properties of a part are determined by
[BasePart.Transparency](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#Transparency) and [BasePart.Reflectance](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#Reflectance).
