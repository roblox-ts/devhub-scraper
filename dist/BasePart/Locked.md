The Locked property determines whether a [`part`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart) (or a
[`model`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Model) it is contained within) may be selected in Roblox
Studio by clicking on it. This property is most often enabled on parts
within environment models that aren't being edited at the moment. Roblox
Studio has a Lock/Unlock All tool that can toggle the Locked state of
every part descendant in a model at once.
