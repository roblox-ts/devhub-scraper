Determines whether or not a part casts a shadow.

Note that this feature is not designed for performance enhancement. It should only be disabled on parts where you want to hide the shadows the part casts. Disabling this property for a given part may cause visual artifacts on the shadows cast upon that part.

The following image shows a red part with CastShadow disabled and a blue part with CastShadow enabled. Note the tapering artifact on the shadow cast on the red part.
