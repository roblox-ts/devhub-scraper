The LocalTransparencyModifier property is a multiplier to [BasePart.Transparency](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BasePart/Transparency) that is only visible to the local client. It does not replicate from client to server. It is useful for when a part should not render for a specific client, such as how the player does not see their character's body parts when they zoom into first person mode.

The property modifies the local part's transparency increases a part's transparency on a scale from 0 to 1 using the following formula:

 ```Lua
-- Calculate the part's client-side transparency. Values greater than 1 round down to 1.
    local clientTransparency = part.Transparency + (1 * part.localTransparencyModifier)
```

Take a look at the table below for an example of how this property affect's a part's client-side transparency:
