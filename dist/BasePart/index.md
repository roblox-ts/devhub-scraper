BasePart is an abstract base class for in-world objects that render and are physically simulated while in the [Workspace](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Workspace). There are several implementations of BasePart, the most common is [Part](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Part), a simple 6-face rectangular prism. Others include [SpawnLocation](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/SpawnLocation), [WedgePart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/WedgePart) and the singleton [Terrain](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Terrain) object within the [Workspace](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Workspace). Most of the time, when documentation refers to a part, most BasePart implementations will work and not just [Part](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Part).

There are **many** different objects that interact with BasePart:

*   They may be grouped within a [Model](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Model), which allows several BasePart to be moved at the same time using [SetPrimaryPartCFrame](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Model/SetPrimaryPartCFrame).
*   A [Decal](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Decal) applies a stretched image texture to the faces of a part, though the exact mapping depends on the type of part.
*   A [Texture](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Texture) applies a tiled image texture to the faces of a part much like a [Decal](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Decal).
*   A [SurfaceGui](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/SurfaceGui) renders [GuiObjects](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/GuiObject) on the face of a part.
*   An [Attachment](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Attachment) can be added to specify a CFrames relative to a parent BasePart. These are often used by physics [Constraint](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Constraint) objects, such as [RopeConstraint](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/RopeConstraint) and [HingeConstraint](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/HingeConstraint).
*   [ParticleEmitter](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ParticleEmitter) emit particles uniformly in the volume of the BasePart to which they are parented.
*   Light objects like [PointLight](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/PointLight) emit light from the center of a BasePart.
*   When [played](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Sound/Play), a [Sound](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Sound) parented to a BasePart will be physically located at the part's position.
*   [BodyMover](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BodyMover) objects like [BodyVelocity](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BodyVelocity) exert forces on the BasePart to which they are parented.
*   As a sibling of a [Humanoid](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Humanoid), they can be used as limbs of a character and also animated when joined using [Motor6D](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Motor6D). If not a sibling of a [Humanoid](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Humanoid), BasePart can still be animated using an [AnimationController](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/AnimationController).
*   In Studio, you can use most implementations of BaseParts with solid modelling.
*   If parented to a [Tool](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Tool) and given the name “Handle”, a BasePart can be held by characters.
*   You can make BasePart interactive by adding a [ClickDetector](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ClickDetector)
*   You can use a mesh like a [BlockMesh](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BlockMesh) or [SpecialMesh](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/SpecialMesh) to change how a BasePart looks without change how it physically behaves.
