The BrickColor property determines the color of a part. If the part has a
[BasePart.Material](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#Material), this also determines the color used when rendering
the material texture. For more control over the color, the
[BasePart.Color](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#Color) property can be used (it is a Color3 variant of this
property). If Color set, this property will use the closest BrickColor.

Other visual properties of a part are determined by
[BasePart.Transparency](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#Transparency) and [BasePart.Reflectance](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#Reflectance).
