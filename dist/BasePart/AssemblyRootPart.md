This property indicates the [BasePart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BasePart) automatically chosen to represent the [assembly's](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Assembly) root part. It is the same part that's returned when developers call [GetRootPart()](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/BasePart/GetRootPart).

The root part can be changed by changing the [RootPriority](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BasePart/RootPriority) of the parts in the assembly.
