This property indicates the [BasePart](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart) automatically chosen to represent
the [assembly](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Assembly)'s root part. It is the same part that's returned
when developers call [GetRootPart()](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#GetRootPart).

The root part can be changed by changing the
[RootPriority](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#RootPriority) of the parts in the assembly.
