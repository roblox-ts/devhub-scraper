The Orientation property describes the part's rotation in degrees around the X, Y and Z axes using a Vector3. The rotations are applied in Y → X → Z order. This differs from proper [Euler angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles), and is instead [Tait–Bryan angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles#Tait-Bryan_angles) which describe **yaw, pitch and roll**. It is also worth noting how this property differs from the `CFrame.Angles()` constructor, which applies rotations in a different order (Z → Y → X). For better control over the rotation of a part, it is recommended that [BasePart.CFrame](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BasePart/CFrame) is set instead.

When setting this property any [Welds](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Weld), [ManualWelds](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ManualWeld), [Snap](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Snap), [Motor](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Motor), and [Motor6Ds](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Motor6D) connected to this part will have the matching [C0](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/JointInstance/C0)/[C1](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/JointInstance/C1) property updated and to allow the part to move relative to any other parts it is joined to.

WeldConstraints will also be temporarily disabled and re-enabled during the move.
