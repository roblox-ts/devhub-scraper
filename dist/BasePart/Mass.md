**Mass** is a read-only property that describes the product of a part's volume and density. It is returned by the [GetMass](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/BasePart/GetMass) function.

*   The volume of a part is determined by its [Size](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BasePart/Size) and its [Shape](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Part/Shape), which varies depending on the kind of BasePart used, such as [WedgePart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/WedgePart).
*   The density of a part is determined by its [Material](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BasePart/Material) or [CustomPhysicalProperties](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BasePart/CustomPhysicalProperties), if specified.

A common use of the Mass property is using it to calculate the magnitude of a gravity-counteracting force. Using a [BodyForce](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BodyForce), apply a upward force equal to the product of a part's Mass and [Workspace.Gravity](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Workspace/Gravity). This will completely counteract the force of gravity on the part.
