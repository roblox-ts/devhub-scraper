Returns a table of parts connected to the the object by any kind of rigid joint.

If _recursive_ is true this function will return all of the parts in the assembly rigidly connected to the BasePart.  

Rigid Joints
------------

When a joint connects two parts together `(Part0 → Part1)`, a joint is **rigid** if the physics of `Part1` are completely locked down by `Part0`.  
This only applies to the following joint types:

*   \`Weld\`
*   \`Snap\`
*   \`ManualWeld\`
*   \`Motor\`
*   \`Motor6D\`
*   \`WeldConstraint\`
