The CenterOfMass property describes the **local** position of a
[`part`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart)'s center of mass. If this is a single part assembly,
this is the `AssemblyCenterOfMass` converted from world space to local. On
simple [`Parts`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Part), the center of mass is always (0,0,0). It can
vary for [`WedgePart`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/WedgePart) or [`MeshPart`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/MeshPart) however.
