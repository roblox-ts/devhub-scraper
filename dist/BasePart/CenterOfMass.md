The CenterOfMass property describes the position in which a
[part](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart)'s [center of mass][1] is located. Should a force be
applied to the part toward this point, the part would not rotate as a
result of this force. **CenterOfMass is currently not enabled.**
