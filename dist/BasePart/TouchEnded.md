Fires when a part stops touching another part under similar conditions to
those of [`BasePart.Touched`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#Touched).

This event works in conjunction with
[`Workspace.TouchesUseCollisionGroups`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Workspace#TouchesUseCollisionGroups) to specify whether
[collision groups](https://create.roblox.com/docs/workspace/collisions#collision-filtering)
are acknowledged for detection.
