CustomPhysicalProperties lets you customize various physical aspects of a
[`Part`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart), such as its density, friction, and elasticity.

If enabled, this property let's you configure these physical properties.
If disabled, these physical properties are determined by the
[`BasePart.Material`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#Material) of the part. The page for `Enum.Material`
contains list of the various part materials.
