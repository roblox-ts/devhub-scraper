CustomPhysicalProperties lets you customize various physical aspects of a
[part](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart), such as its's density, friction, and elasticity.

If enabled, this property let's you configure these physical properties.
If disabled, these physical properties are determined by the
[BasePart.Material](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#Material) of the part. The page for [Material](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/enum/Material) contains
