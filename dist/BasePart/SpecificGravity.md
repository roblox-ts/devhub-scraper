The ratio of the part's density to the density of water determined by the
[BasePart.Material](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#Material). Effects the part's behavior when in a water terrain
cell. Essentially, SpecificGravity refers to how many times more dense a
part is than water.
