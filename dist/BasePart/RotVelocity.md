The RotVelocity of a [part](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart) describes how its
[BasePart.Orientation](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#Orientation) is presently changing. In other words, this
property describes how the fast part is rotating. The part only rotates if
it is not anchored.

The unit of this property is **radians per second**.

Using this in conjunction with [AlignOrientation](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AlignOrientation) allows for aligned parts
to have matching RotVelocity and Orientation values.
