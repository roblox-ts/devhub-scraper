**CanQuery** determines whether the part is considered during spatial query operations, namely [GetPartBoundsInBox](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/WorldRoot/GetPartBoundsInBox), [GetPartBoundsInRadius](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/WorldRoot/GetPartBoundsInRadius) and [GetPartsInPart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/WorldRoot/GetPartsInPart). These functions will never include parts whose CanQuery is false.

Beyond this property, it is also possible to blacklist parts which are descendants of a given list of parts using an [OverlapParams](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/datatype/OverlapParams) object when calling the spatial query functions.
