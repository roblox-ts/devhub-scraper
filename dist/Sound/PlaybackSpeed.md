Determines the speed at which a [`Sound`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Sound) will play. The greater the
value the faster the sound will play back.

For example, a value of 2 will cause the [`Sound`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Sound) to play 2x faster,
whereas a value of 0.5 will cause it to play 2x slower. When PlaybackSpeed
is equal to 1, the sound will take [`Sound.TimeLength`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Sound#TimeLength) (in seconds)
to complete.

Note that increasing the PlaybackSpeed of a sound will cause it to play at
a higher pitch.
