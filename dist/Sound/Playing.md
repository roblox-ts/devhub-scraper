Indicates whether the [Sound](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Sound) is currently playing. This can be toggled, and this property will always replicate.

This property should not be confused with [Sound.IsPlaying](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Sound/IsPlaying) which is a read-only property. Playing can be set to true or false to start or stop the playback of a sound.

Note that when Playing is set to false, the [Sound.TimePosition](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Sound/TimePosition) property of the sound will not reset. This means when the Playing is set to true again the audio will continue from the time position it was at when it was stopped. However, if the [Sound:Play](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Sound/Play) function is used to resume the sound the time position will reset to 0.
