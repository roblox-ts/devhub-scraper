A number between 0 and 1000 indicating how loud the [`Sound`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Sound) is
currently playing back.

This property reflects the amplitude of the [`Sound`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Sound)'s playback in
the instance of time it is read. Therefore, for most sounds it will
fluctuate constantly. Due to this it can appear in the Roblox Studio
properties window as 0, however when read by code in the command bar or
[`Script`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Script)s it will return the correct value.
