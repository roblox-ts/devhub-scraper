Fires whenever the [Sound](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Sound) is paused using [Sound:Pause](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Sound/Pause).

As with [Sound.Played](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/Sound/Played), [Sound.Resumed](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/Sound/Resumed) and [Sound.Stopped](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/Sound/Stopped) only the respective sound function will cause the event to fire. This means that Pause will only fire when [Sound:Pause](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Sound/Pause) is called.
