The maximum distance, in studs, a client's listener can be from the [Sound's](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Sound) origin and still hear it. Only applies to Sounds parented to a [Part](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Part) or [Attachment](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Attachment) (3D sounds).

How RollOffMaxDistance impacts the attenuation of a sound (manner in which it fades out) is dependent on the [Sound.RollOffMode](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Sound/RollOffMode) property. When RollOffMode is set to use an inverse type distance model (Inverse or InverseTapered) the RollOffMaxDistance will not effect the attenuation of the sound. This means that low values for RollOffMaxDistance will cause the sound to abruptly cut off when the listener reaches the RollOffMaxDistance. In most cases this is not desirable and developers are advised not to use low RollOffMaxDistance values.

When RollOffMode is set to a linear type distance model (Linear or LinearSquared) the sound will attenuate between [Sound.EmitterSize](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Sound/EmitterSize) and MaxDistance (with playback volume reaching zero at RollOffMaxDistance). This is less realistic, but in some cases allows attenuation to be handled in a more intuitive way.
