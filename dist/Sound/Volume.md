The volume of the [Sound](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Sound). Can be set between 0 and 10. Defaults to 0.5

Note that if the [Sound](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Sound) is a member of a [SoundGroup](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/SoundGroup) its playback volume (but not the Volume property) will be influenced by the [SoundGroup.Volume](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/SoundGroup/Volume) property of that [SoundGroup](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/SoundGroup). The effect of this is multiplicative, meaning that a sound will play at the same volume if its Volume is 0.1 and its [SoundGroup](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/SoundGroup)'s volume is 5 and vice-versa.
