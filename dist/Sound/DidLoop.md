Event that fires whenever the [Sound](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Sound) loops. Returns soundId and numOfTimesLooped, giving the contentID of the sound and the number of times looped respectively.

When the [Sound](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Sound) is stopped the looped counter resets meaning the next DidLoop event will return 1 for numOfTimesLooped.
