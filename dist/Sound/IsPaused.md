This read-only property will return true when the [Sound](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Sound) is not playing. Note that this property will not only return true once a sound has been paused using the [Sound:Pause](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Sound/Pause) function but also if it has been stopped using the [Sound:Stop](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Sound/Stop) function or never been played.

This property will only be true when [Sound.IsPlaying](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Sound/IsPlaying) is false.

As IsPaused is read only it can not be used to stop the sound, [Sound:Stop](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Sound/Stop) and [Sound:Pause](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Sound/Pause) should be used instead.
