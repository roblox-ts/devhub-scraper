The minimum distance at which a 3D [Sound](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Sound) (direct child of a [BasePart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BasePart) or [Attachment](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Attachment)) will begin to attenuate (decrease in volume).

Sounds parented to a [BasePart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BasePart) or [Attachment](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Attachment) that are descendants of the [Workspace](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Workspace) are considered 3D sounds and their volume whilst playing is dependent on the distance between the client's sound listener ([Camera](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Camera) position by default) and the Sound's parent. Two properties influence this behavior [Sound.EmitterSize](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Sound/EmitterSize) and [Sound.RollOffMode](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Sound/RollOffMode).

The way the [Sound](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Sound) attenuates (fades out) after the distance between the listener and the sound exceeds the [Sound.EmitterSize](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Sound/EmitterSize) is determined by [Sound.RollOffMode](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Sound/RollOffMode).
