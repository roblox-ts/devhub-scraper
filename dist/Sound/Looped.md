This sets whether or not the [Sound](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Sound) repeats once it has finished when it
is playing.

Looped sounds are suitable for a range of applications including music and
background ambient sounds. The [Sound.DidLoop](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Sound#DidLoop) event can be used to track
the number of times as sound has looped.
