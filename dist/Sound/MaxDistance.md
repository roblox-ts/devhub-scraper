The maximum distance a client's listener can be from the [Sound](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Sound)'s origin and still hear it. Only applies to [Sound](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Sound)s parented to a [Part](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Part) or [Attachment](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Attachment) (3D sounds).

How MaxDistance impacts the attenuation of a sound (manner in which it fades out) is dependent on the [Sound.RollOffMode](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Sound/RollOffMode) property. When [Sound.RollOffMode](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Sound/RollOffMode) is set to use an inverse type distance model (Inverse or InverseTapered) the MaxDistance will not effect the attenuation of the sound. This means that low values for MaxDistance will cause the sound to abruptly cut off when the listener reaches the MaxDistance. In most cases this is not desirable and developers are advised not to use low MaxDistance values.

When [Sound.RollOffMode](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Sound/RollOffMode) is set to a linear type distance model (Linear or LinearSquared) the sound will attenuate between [Sound.EmitterSize](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Sound/EmitterSize) and MaxDistance (with playback volume reaching zero at MaxDistance). This is less realistic, but in some cases allows attenuation to be handled in a more intuitive way.
