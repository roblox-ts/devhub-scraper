A [Sound](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Sound) is an object that emits sound. See [Adding Sounds](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/adding-sounds) for more info on how to upload a sound file.

2D and 3D Sound
---------------

A sound placed in a [BasePart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BasePart) or an [Attachment](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Attachment) will emit its sound from that part's [BasePart.Position](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BasePart/Position) or the attachment's [Attachment.WorldPosition](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Attachment/WorldPosition). A sound exhibits the Doppler effect, meaning its frequency and pitch varies with the relative motion of whatever attachment or part it is attached to. The volume of the sound will be determined by the distance between the client's sound listener (by default the [Camera](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Camera) position) and the position of the sound's parent. For more information on this see [Sound.RollOffMode](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Sound/RollOffMode).

A sound is considered “global” if it is not parented to a [BasePart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BasePart) or an [Attachment](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Attachment). In this case, the sound will play at the same volume throughout the entire place.

Sound Replication
-----------------

Sound playback is not filtered. If a particular client starts playing a sound, all of the other clients will also play it unless [SoundService.RespectFilteringEnabled](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/SoundService/RespectFilteringEnabled) is set to true.

#### Important

*   While the playback of sounds will replicate, other properties such as the playback speed, pitch, volume, etc. will **not** replicate. This behavior can be avoided by creating all sounds locally on the client, as instancing sounds will not replicate to the server.
*   [Sound.TimePosition](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Sound/TimePosition), [Sound.TimeLength](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Sound/TimeLength), and [Sound.Playing](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Sound/Playing) will all properly replicate when set from the server.
