Fires whenever the [Sound](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Sound) is played using the [Sound:Play](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Sound/Play) function.

As with [Sound.Stopped](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/Sound/Stopped), [Sound.Paused](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/Sound/Paused) and [Sound.Resumed](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/Sound/Resumed) only the respective sound function will cause the event to fire. This means that Played will only fire when [Sound:Play](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Sound/Play) is called. This event will not fire if the [Sound](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Sound) is played due to the sound being destroyed and [Sound.PlayOnRemove](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Sound/PlayOnRemove) being set to true.
