This read-only property will return true when the [Sound](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Sound) is playing.

This property can only be true when [Sound.IsPaused](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Sound/IsPaused) is false.

As IsPlaying is read only it can not be used to play the sound, [Sound:Play](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Sound/Play) should be used instead.
