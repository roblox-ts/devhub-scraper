This read-only property will return true when the [`Sound`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Sound) is
playing.

This property can only be true when [`Sound.IsPaused`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Sound#IsPaused) is false.

As IsPlaying is read only it can not be used to play the sound,
[`Sound:Play()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Sound#Play) should be used instead.
