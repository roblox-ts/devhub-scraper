The Pause function halts playback of its [Tween](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Tween). However the progress variables of the tween will not be reset, meaning that when [TweenBase:Play](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/TweenBase/Play) is called again the tween will resume playback from the moment it was paused.

If a developer wishes to reset the progress variables of the tween, they should use [TweenBase:Cancel](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/TweenBase/Cancel).

This means a tween paused half way through its animation will take half of its duration to complete when resumed.
