The MaxTorque property determines the limit of the torque that may be
exerted on each world axis. If a part isn't moving, consider raising this
value (and also check that it is not [`Anchored`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#Anchored) or
attached to another anchored part). See also
[`P`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BodyAngularVelocity#P) (power).
