The P property determines how much
[power](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)>) is used while
applying torque in order to reach the goal
[AngularVelocity](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BodyAngularVelocity#AngularVelocity). The higher this
value, the more power will be used and the faster it will be used.
