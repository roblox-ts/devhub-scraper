The BodyAngularVelocity object applies a [torque][1] (or **rotational force**)
on a [BasePart](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart) such that it maintains a constant [angular velocity][3] as
determined by its [AngularVelocity](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BodyAngularVelocity#AngularVelocity)
property. This allows for the creation of parts that continually rotate. It is
the rotational counterpart to a [BodyVelocity](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BodyVelocity). If you would like to maintain
a constant [angular displacement][2], use a [BodyGyro](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BodyGyro) instead.
