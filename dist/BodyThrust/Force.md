The Force property determines the amount of force exerted on each axis relative to the part. Unlike [BodyForce.Force](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BodyForce/Force), this property is relative to the part and not the world. The force is exerted at the [Location](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BodyThrust/Location), which is also relative to the part.
