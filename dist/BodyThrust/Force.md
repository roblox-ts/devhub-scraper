The Force property determines the amount of force exerted on each axis
relative to the part. Unlike [BodyForce.Force](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BodyForce#Force), this property is relative
to the part and not the world. The force is exerted at the
[Location](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BodyThrust#Location), which is also relative to the part.
