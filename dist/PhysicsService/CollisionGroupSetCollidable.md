Sets the collision status between two groups. This method will throw an
error if either of the groups is unregistered, so it's recommended that
you confirm each group's registration through
[`PhysicsService:IsCollisionGroupRegistered()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PhysicsService#IsCollisionGroupRegistered) before making this
call.
