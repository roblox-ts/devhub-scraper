PostEffect is an abstract base class for post-processing effects, such as [BloomEffect](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BloomEffect) and [ColorCorrectionEffect](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ColorCorrectionEffect). They change how the world looks **after** it has been rendered. They do not affect [GuiObject](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/GuiObject)s. Objects of this kind should be parented to the [Lighting](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Lighting) or the [Workspace.CurrentCamera](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Workspace/CurrentCamera) in order to work.

It should also be noted that some post-processing effects will work differently or **not at all** when Roblox is set to a low [QualityLevel](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/RenderSettings/QualityLevel) (or [EditQualityLevel](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/RenderSettings/EditQualityLevel) in Studio). On some low-end devices, faster rendering algorithms may be used. By default, these quality settings are set to Automatic, so if you aren't seeing post-processing effects you should check Roblox's settings under the “Rendering” section. It may be necessary to override the automatic behavior temporarily in order to preview post-processing effects.
