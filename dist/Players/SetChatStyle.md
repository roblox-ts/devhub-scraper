This function sets whether BubbleChat and ClassicChat are being used, and
tells TeamChat and Chat what to do using the [`Enum.ChatStyle`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/ChatStyle) enum. Since
this item is protected, attempting to use it in a [`Script`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Script) or
[`LocalScript`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/LocalScript) will cause an error.

This function is used internally when the chat mode is set by the game.
