This function makes the [`Players.LocalPlayer`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Players#LocalPlayer) chat the given
message, which will only be viewable by users on the same team. Since this
item is protected, attempting to use it in a [`Script`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Script) or
[`LocalScript`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/LocalScript) will cause an error.

This function is used internally when the [`Players.LocalPlayer`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Players#LocalPlayer)
sends a message to their team.
