The **PreferredPlayers** property indicates the number of players to which
Roblox's matchmaker will fill servers. This number will be less than the
maximum number of players ([`Players.MaxPlayers`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Players#MaxPlayers)) supported by the
experience.
