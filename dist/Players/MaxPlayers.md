The **MaxPlayers** property determines the maximum number of players that
can be in a server. This property can only be set through a specific
place's settings on the
[Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/docs/https://create.roblox.com/creations) or through
[Game Settings](https://create.roblox.com/docs/studio/game-settings).
