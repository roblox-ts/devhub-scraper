The MaxPlayers [Players](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Players) property determines the maximum amount of players
that can be in this server.

While this property cannot be set through [Script](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Script)s or [LocalScript](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/LocalScript)s
in-game, it can be set from the place settings' _Access_ tab on the site.

You can change this value depending on the number of player's you would
like to limit in a single server. The number of players in a server
affects the feel of your game and it's performance.
