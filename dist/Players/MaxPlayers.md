The MaxPlayers [Players](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Players) property determines the maximum amount of players that can be in this server.

While this property cannot be set through [Script](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Script)s or [LocalScript](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/LocalScript)s in-game, it can be set from the place settings' _Access_ tab on the site.

You can change this value depending on the number of player's you would like to limit in a single server. The number of players in a server affects the feel of your game and it's performance.
