This function makes the local player chat the given message. Since this
item is protected, attempting to use it in a [`Script`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Script) or
[`LocalScript`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/LocalScript) will cause an error.

Instead, when creating a custom chat system, or a system that needs access
to the chat, you can use the [`Chat`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Chat) service's [`Chat:Chat()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Chat#Chat)
function instead.
