This function makes the local player chat the given message. Since this item is protected, attempting to use it in a [Script](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Script) or [LocalScript](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/LocalScript) will cause an error.

Instead, when creating a custom chat system, or a system that needs access to the chat, you can use the [Chat](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Chat) service's [Chat:Chat](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Chat/Chat) function instead.
