The BubbleChat [Players](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Players) property indicates whether or not bubble chat is enabled. It is set with the [Players:SetChatStyle](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Players/SetChatStyle) method using the [ChatStyle](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/enum/ChatStyle) enum.

When this chat mode is enabled, the game displays chats in the chat user interface at the top-left corner of the screen.

There are two other chat modes, [Players.ClassicChat](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Players/ClassicChat) and a chat mode where both classic and bubble chat are enabled.
