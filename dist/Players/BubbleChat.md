The BubbleChat [Players](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Players) property indicates whether or not bubble chat is
enabled. It is set with the [Players:SetChatStyle](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Players#SetChatStyle) method using the
[ChatStyle](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/enum/ChatStyle) enum.

When this chat mode is enabled, the game displays chats in the chat user
interface at the top-left corner of the screen.

There are two other chat modes, [Players.ClassicChat](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Players#ClassicChat) and a chat mode
where both classic and bubble chat are enabled.
