The **Players** service contains [`Player`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player) objects for presently
connected clients to a Roblox server. It also contains information about a
place's configuration. It can fetch information about players not connected to
the server, such as character appearances, friends, and avatar thumbnail.
