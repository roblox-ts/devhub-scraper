The Players game service contains only [Player](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Player) objects for presently
connected clients to a Roblox game server. It also contains information about
a place's configuration (such as bubble chat or classic chat). It can fetch
information about players not connected to the server, such as character
appearances, friends and avatar thumbnail.
