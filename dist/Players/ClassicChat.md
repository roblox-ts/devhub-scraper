Indicates whether or not classic chat is enabled. This property is set by
the [`Players:SetChatStyle()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Players#SetChatStyle) method using the `Enum.ChatStyle` enum.

When this chat mode is enabled, the game displays chats in a bubble above
the sender's head.

There are two other chat modes, [`Players.BubbleChat`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Players#BubbleChat) and a chat mode
where both classic and bubble chat are enabled.
