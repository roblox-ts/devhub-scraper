This function will send a query to the Roblox website asking what the [Player.UserId](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Player/UserId) is of the account with the given [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player) name.

This method errors if no account exists with the given username. If you aren't certain such an account exists, it's recommended to wrap calls to this function with `pcall`. In addition, you can manually cache results to quickly make future calls with the same username. See the code samples to learn how to do this.
