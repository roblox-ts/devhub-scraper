This property is true when any position on the [`BasePart`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart) is
touching [`Terrain`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Terrain) water. The detection measurements are not exact
and may use the bounding box of the part instead of its exact geometry.
