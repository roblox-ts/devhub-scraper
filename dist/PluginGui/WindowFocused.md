**WindowFocused** fires immediately when the user starts interacting with the PluginGui's window, usually by clicking on it. This functions works similarly to the similarly-named [UserInputService.WindowFocused](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/UserInputService/WindowFocused) event. It fires before any [GuiObject.InputBegan](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/GuiObject/InputBegan) events related to mouse buttons.

If another [PluginGui](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/PluginGui) is in focus and the user focuses this PluginGui, then this event fires after the other's [WindowFocusReleased](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/PluginGui/WindowFocusReleased) event. However, if the main game window was in focus, this event fires **after** [UserInputService.WindowFocusReleased](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/UserInputService/WindowFocusReleased).
