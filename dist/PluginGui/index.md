PluginGui is an abstract class for GUIs that allow the display of
[`GuiObjects`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiObject) in various Roblox Studio widgets. As of right
now, the only available PluginGui type is [`DockWidgetPluginGui`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DockWidgetPluginGui), but
there may be more in the future!
