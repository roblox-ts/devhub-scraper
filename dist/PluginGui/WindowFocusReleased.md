**WindowFocusReleased** fires immediately when the user stops interacting with the PluginGui's window, usually by clicking on on something not in the window. This functions works similarly to the similarly-named [UserInputService.WindowFocusReleased](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/UserInputService/WindowFocusReleased) event.

If focus is moving to another [PluginGui](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/PluginGui) while the user had this PluginGui in focus, then this event fires before the other's [WindowFocused](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/PluginGui/WindowFocused) event. However, if the main game window is being put in focus, this event fires **after** [UserInputService.WindowFocused](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/UserInputService/WindowFocused).
