Fired when a player chooses something to say, through a [`Dialog`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Dialog)
instance.

This event is client-side only and will not fire on the server. It should
be connected to in either a [`LocalScript`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/LocalScript) or a [`ModuleScript`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ModuleScript)
required by a [`LocalScript`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/LocalScript).
