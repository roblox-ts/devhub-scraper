The Dialog object allows users to create non-player characters (NPCs) that
players can talk to using a list of choices. The Dialog object can be inserted
into a part such as a Humanoid's head, and then a player will see a speech
bubble above the part that they can click on to start a conversation. The
creator of a place can choose what choices the player can say by inserting
[DialogChoice](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/DialogChoice) objects into the dialog.
