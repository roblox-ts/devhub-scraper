[`PromptGameInvite()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SocialService#PromptGameInvite) displays an
invite prompt to the local player through which they may invite their
friends to the current experience. Before calling this method, you should
use
[`CanSendGameInviteAsync()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SocialService#CanSendGameInviteAsync) to
determine whether the player can send an invite, as this ability may vary
depending on the platform or player.
