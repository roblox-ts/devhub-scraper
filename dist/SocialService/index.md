SocialService facilitates social functions that impact relationships made on
the Roblox platform. Developers are able to
[prompt](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SocialService#PromptGameInvite) their players to send game invitation
requests to players' friends and leverage signals when users invite their
friends to their games

Below is the Invitation Popup players will see:
