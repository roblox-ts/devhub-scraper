**SocialService** facilitates social functions that impact relationships made
on the Roblox platform. Its primary usage is to show
[invite prompts](https://create.roblox.com/docs/production/promotion/invite-prompts) to players
which allow them to send invitation requests to their friends through
[`SocialService:PromptGameInvite()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SocialService#PromptGameInvite) and leverage signals when such
requests are made.
