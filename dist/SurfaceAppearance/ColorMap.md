This property determines the color and opacity of the surface. This
texture is sometimes called the albedo texture. The alpha channel of this
texture controls its opacity, which behaves differently based on the
[SurfaceAppearance.AlphaMode](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SurfaceAppearance#AlphaMode) setting.
