This property determines the color and opacity of the surface. This texture is sometimes called the albedo texture. The alpha channel of this texture controls its opacity, which behaves differently based on the [SurfaceAppearance.AlphaMode](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/SurfaceAppearance/AlphaMode) setting.
