Controls the throttle rate of Roblox's physics engine.

By default, the physics engine will adjust the physics environment throttle depending on how much work the physics engine is doing, and the current framerate. See the enum page for [EnviromentalPhysicsThrottle](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/enum/EnviromentalPhysicsThrottle "EnviromentalPhysicsThrottle") for more information.
