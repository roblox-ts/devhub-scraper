Controls the throttle rate of Roblox's physics engine. By default, the
physics engine will adjust the physics environment throttle depending on
how much work the physics engine is doing, and the current framerate. See
the enum page for
[EnviromentalPhysicsThrottle](/reference/engine/enums/EnviromentalPhysicsThrottle)
for more information.
