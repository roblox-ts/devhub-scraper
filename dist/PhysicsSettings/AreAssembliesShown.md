When set to true, each physics assembly is assigned a unique color and the
[`Part`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Part) associated with the assembly are outlined with the color.
Parts that are attached together by [`JointInstance`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/JointInstance) will share the
same color.
