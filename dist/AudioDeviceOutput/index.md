[`AudioDeviceOutput`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AudioDeviceOutput) accepts audio streams to be rendered out to physical
hardware devices such as speakers or headphones. It provides a single
**Input** pin that can be targeted by [`Wires`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Wire). Any audio streams
wired to an [`AudioDeviceOutput`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AudioDeviceOutput) are heard.
