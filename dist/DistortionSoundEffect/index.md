A distortion effect is used to simulate the effect that would occur when
overdriving older style audio equipment (such as vaccuum tubes). This effect
causes clipping in the sound and adds a general “fuzzyness”.

Like all other [SoundEffect](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SoundEffect), a DistortionSoundEffect can be applied either to
a [Sound](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Sound) or [SoundGroup](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SoundGroup) by being parented to either.
