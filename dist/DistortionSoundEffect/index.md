A distortion effect is used to simulate the effect that would occur when overdriving older style audio equipment (such as vaccuum tubes). This effect causes clipping in the sound and adds a general “fuzzyness”.  
  
Like all other [SoundEffect](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/SoundEffect), a DistortionSoundEffect can be applied either to a [Sound](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Sound) or [SoundGroup](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/SoundGroup) by being parented to either.
