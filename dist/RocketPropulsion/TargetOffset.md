The TargetOffset property determines the world offset from the
[Target](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/RocketPropulsion#Target). Basically, it makes the
[RocketPropulsion](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/RocketPropulsion) behave as if the target were really offset by this
property. It is especially useful when Target is set to nil, since this
property then acts as the target position.
