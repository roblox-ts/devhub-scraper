The MaxThrust property determines the upper limit of the thrust that may
be exerted to move the part. Parts or assemblies that have high
[mass](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#GetMass) will require more thrust in order to to remain
airborne, and thus track the [Target](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/RocketPropulsion#Target).
