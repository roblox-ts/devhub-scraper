The P property determines how much
[power](https://create.roblox.com/docs/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)) is used while
applying force in order to reach the
[`Target`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/RocketPropulsion#Target) position. The higher this value,
the more power will be used and the faster it will be used. This property
works similarly to [`BodyPosition.P`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BodyPosition#P).
