The D property is used to dampen the velocity of the part in order to
prevent it from overshooting the [Target](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/RocketPropulsion#Target) and
causing a **rubber-banding** effect. It behaves similarly to
[BodyPosition.D](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BodyPosition#D).
