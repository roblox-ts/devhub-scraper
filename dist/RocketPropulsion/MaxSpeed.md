The MaxSpeed property determines the upper limit of the velocity at which
the part will move toward the [`Target`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/RocketPropulsion#Target). A
[`RocketPropulsion`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/RocketPropulsion) will apply a force to decelerate a part if it
exceeds this speed limit.
