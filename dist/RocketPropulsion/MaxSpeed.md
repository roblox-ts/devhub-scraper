The MaxSpeed property determines the upper limit of the velocity at which the part will move toward the [Target](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/RocketPropulsion/Target). A [RocketPropulsion](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/RocketPropulsion) will apply a force to decelerate a part if it exceeds this speed limit.
