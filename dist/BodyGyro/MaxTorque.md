The MaxTorque property determines the limit on the amount of torque that may be applied on each axis in reaching the goal orientation ([CFrame](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BodyGyro/CFrame)). If a part isn't moving, consider increasing this value (also check that it is not [Anchored](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BasePart/Anchored) or attached to any anchored parts).
