The MaxTorque property determines the limit on the amount of torque that
may be applied on each axis in reaching the goal orientation
([`CFrame`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BodyGyro#CFrame)). If a part isn't moving, consider
increasing this value (also check that it is not
[`Anchored`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#Anchored) or attached to any anchored parts).
