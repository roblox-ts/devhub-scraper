The P property determines how much
[power](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)>) is used while
applying torque in order to reach the goal [CFrame](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BodyGyro#CFrame). The
higher this value, the more power will be used and the faster it will be
used.
