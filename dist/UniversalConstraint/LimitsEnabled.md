This property, when enabled, limits the relative angular motion of the
primary axes of attachments through a cone constraint. The default value
is false.

The example below demonstrates how developers can enable a cone limit on
the relative motion of the primary axes:

```lua
universalConstraint.LimitsEnabled = true
```
