This property determines the max angle, in degrees, of the constraint's
limiting cone, formed from [`Attachment0`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Constraint#Attachment0) and
its primary axis. The default value is 45 degrees.

In order for this property to take affect, the constraint's
[`LimitsEnabled`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UniversalConstraint#LimitsEnabled) property must be
set to true.
