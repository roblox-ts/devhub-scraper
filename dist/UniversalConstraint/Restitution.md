This property determines the restitution of the two
[`Attachments`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Attachment) connected by the
[`UniversalConstraint`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UniversalConstraint) when they reach the end of the range specified
by [`MaxAngle`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UniversalConstraint#MaxAngle). The value defaults to 0
and can be any floating number in the range of 0 to 1. Only applies when
[`LimitsEnabled`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UniversalConstraint#LimitsEnabled) is set to true.
