This property determines the restitution of the two limits, or how elastic
they are. The value defaults to 0 and can be any floating number in the
range [0, 1].

    This property only applies when [UniversalConstraint.LimitsEnabled](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UniversalConstraint#LimitsEnabled) is set to true.

The elasticity affects the [Attachments](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Attachment) connected by the
[UniversalConstraint](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UniversalConstraint) when they reach the end of the range specified by
[UniversalConstraint.MaxAngle](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UniversalConstraint#MaxAngle).
