A physics constraint that ensures two axes on two rigid bodies remain perpendicular. An example use of this constraint are power transmission between the transmission and rear drive shafts of rear-wheel drive cars, robotics, etc.

The constraint makes the secondary axes of two attachments perpendicular. If [LimitsEnabled](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/UniversalConstraint/LimitsEnabled) then the relative motion of the primary axis of [Attachment1](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Constraint/Attachment1) is limited by a cone. This cone is formed via [Attachment0](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Constraint/Attachment0) and its primary axis and makes an angle of [MaxAngle](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/UniversalConstraint/MaxAngle) with it.
