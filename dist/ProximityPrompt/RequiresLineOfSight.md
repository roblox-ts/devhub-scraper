This property indicates whether the prompt is hidden if the path between
the player's [Camera](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Camera) and object parented to the [ProximityPrompt](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ProximityPrompt) is
obstructed. If true, this prompt will only be shown if there is a clear
path from the camera to the object.

The parent [Part](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Part) or [Model](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Model) of the prompt will be excluded from this
check.
