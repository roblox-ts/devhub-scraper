This property serves as a reference to the [LocalizationTable](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/LocalizationTable) used to apply automated localization to the ProximityPrompt's [ProximityPrompt.ActionText](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/ProximityPrompt/ActionText) and [ProximityPrompt.ObjectText](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/ProximityPrompt/ObjectText). In order for this to appy, [ProximityPrompt.AutoLocalize](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/ProximityPrompt/AutoLocalize) must be set.

Developers can set this to reference a LocalizationTable anywhere in the [DataModel](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/DataModel). It is not required to be a child of [LocalizationService](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/LocalizationService). If there is no translation available in the referenced table it will look for a translation in the parent of that table, if it is also a LocalizationTable, and so on.
