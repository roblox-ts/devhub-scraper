InvokeChatCallback will call a function registered by [RegisterChatCallback](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Chat/RegisterChatCallback), given the ChatCallbackType enum and the arguments to send the function. It will return the result of the registered function, or raise an error if no function has been registered.

This function is called by the Lua Chat System so that chat callbacks may be registered to change the behavior of certain features. Unless you are replacing the default Lua Chat System with your own, you should not need to call this function. You can read about the different callback functions at [Chat:RegisterChatCallback](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Chat/RegisterChatCallback).
