The FilterStringForPlayerAsync function filters a string appropriate to
the given player's age settings, so they see what is appropriate to them.
This function will only work if called from a [`Script`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Script) on the
server. If called on a client it will fail.
