The **Chat** service houses the Lua code responsible for running the `/articles/Lua Chat System|Lua Chat System`. Similar to [StarterPlayerScripts](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/StarterPlayerScripts), default objects like [Scripts](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Script) and [ModuleScripts](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ModuleScript) are inserted into the service.

In addition to housing the `/articles/Lua Chat System|Lua Chat System`, this service also exposes functions used to filter text: `Chat/FilterStringAsync|FilterStringAsync()` and `Chat/FilterStringForBroadcast|FilterStringForBroadcast()`. Note that **games which implement custom chat systems must use these functions to filter chat properly.** See `articles/Text and Chat Filtering|Text and Chat Filtering` for more information.
