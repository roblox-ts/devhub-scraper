The Flag is a unit spawned with a [FlagStand](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/FlagStand) object, and will respawn when captured.  
  
When a player touches this object's Handle, which must be a child of the Flag object, which is a Part named “Handle”, the flag will be added to the player's backpack and will appear in their hand. A player cannot select other weapons while carrying a flag, and can drop the flag at anytime by pressing “Backspace” on the keyboard.  
  
If the player carrying a flag steps onto another FlagStand of a different team color, the flag will be removed from the player's backpack and a point will be added to the user's [leaderstats](https://developer.roblox.com/articles/Leaderboards), if provided. The flag will then regenerate at the originating flag stand.  
  
This allows for 'Capture the Flag' to be made games very easily, which was the reason for its creation.
