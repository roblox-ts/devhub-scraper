The base class for [`WrapTarget`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/WrapTarget) and [`WrapLayer`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/WrapLayer) objects. Note that
[`MeshPart`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/MeshPart) is the only valid parent type for [`BaseWrap`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BaseWrap) and that
it behaves more like a component of [`MeshPart`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/MeshPart) than an independent
object.
