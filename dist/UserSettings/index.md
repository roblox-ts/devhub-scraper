UserSettings is a singleton object that is used to house basic user settings,
which persist across all games. Currently, it only stores the
[UserGameSettings](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/UserGameSettings) object.

You can retrieve a reference to this object via the `UserSettings()` function,
which returns it.
