UserSettings is a singleton object that is used to house basic user settings, which persist across all games. Currently, it only stores the [UserGameSettings](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/UserGameSettings) object.

You can retrieve a reference to this object via the `UserSettings()` function, which returns it.
