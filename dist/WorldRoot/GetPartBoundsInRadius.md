**GetPartBoundsInRadius** returns an array of parts whose _bounding boxes_ overlap a sphere whose volume is described using the given center (Vector3) and radius (number).

Beware that this spatial query function efficiently considers the volume of parts' bounding boxes rather than their actual occupied volume. This may be important when considering cylinders, spheres, unions, and [MeshPart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/MeshPart), which have non-block shapes. For cases where accuracy particularly matters, use [GetPartsInPart](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/WorldRoot/GetPartsInPart) instead or further filter the results of this function yourself.

This function uses an [OverlapParams](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/datatype/OverlapParams) object to describe reusable portions of the spatial query, such as an instance whitelist/blacklist, the maximum number of parts to query, and what [collision group](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/collision-filtering) to use. When making repeated spatial queries using functions like this, you should construct just one of these objects and reuse it.

This and other spatial query functions do not consider parts' [CanCollide](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BasePart/CanCollide) or [CanTouch](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BasePart/CanTouch) properties. However, it will consider parts' collision group if specified by the given OverlapParams.
