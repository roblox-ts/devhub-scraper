This function is a variant of [`WorldRoot:FindPartOnRay()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/WorldRoot#FindPartOnRay) with the
addition of an ignore list. This lets you ignore certain parts or
[`Models`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Model).

Those looking to **include** a specific group of objects should instead
use [`WorldRoot:FindPartOnRayWithWhitelist()`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/WorldRoot#FindPartOnRayWithWhitelist).
