This function moves a table of [parts](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Part) to [CFrames](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/datatype/CFrame) in a table of CFrames, without firing property changed events. Not firing property changes makes this a very fast method for moving parts, at the cost of the changes not replicating to the client or being recognized by the undo history.
