**GetPartsInPart** returns an array of parts whose occupied space is shared with the given part, which must exist in the same WorldRoot ([Workspace](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Workspace)) as the parts to be queried.

Queried parts that are merely touching the given part are considered occupying the same space. This function can be used in place of [BasePart:GetTouchingParts](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/BasePart/GetTouchingParts), and is generally a better choice in most cases.

Beware that this spatial query function considers the exact volume occupied by the given part using a full geometric collision check. A concave/hollow part won't match queried parts within it unless they actually overlap/touch such a part. For simpler volumes, consider using [GetPartBoundsInBox](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/WorldRoot/GetPartBoundsInBox) or [GetPartBoundsInRadius](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/WorldRoot/GetPartBoundsInRadius) instead, as they are faster at the cost of being less accurate.

This function uses an [OverlapParams](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/datatype/OverlapParams) object to describe reusable portions of the spatial query, such as an instance whitelist/blacklist, the maximum number of parts to query, and what [collision group](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/collision-filtering) to use. When making repeated spatial queries using functions like this, you should construct just one of these objects and reuse it.

This and other spatial query functions do not consider parts' [CanCollide](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BasePart/CanCollide) or [CanTouch](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BasePart/CanTouch) properties. However, it will consider parts' collision group if specified by the given OverlapParams.
