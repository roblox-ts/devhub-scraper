For handles to be interactive, they must be parented to a player's PlayerGui
or the CoreGui.

A **ConeHandleAdornment** is a cone that can be adorned to a [`BasePart`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart).
This adornment can listen to input events and is commonly used to make dragger
tools.
