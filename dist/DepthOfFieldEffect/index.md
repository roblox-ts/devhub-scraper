The **DepthOfFieldEffect** simulates a camera lens by blurring parts of a
scene not in focus. Distant objects can be blurred or this effect can be used
to focus on specific parts of a scene, like an item in an in-game shop.

Like other post-processing effects, **DepthOfFieldEffect** will only work
while [`Enabled`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PostEffect#Enabled) and when parented to [`Lighting`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Lighting)
or [`Workspace.CurrentCamera`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Workspace#CurrentCamera). Also, it may render differently on low-end
devices or depending on your Studio settings (see the **Quality Level**
settings in **Rendering** â†’ **Performance**).

For more details on this effect and others, see
[Post-Processing Effects](https://create.roblox.com/docs/environment/post-processing-effects).
