The **DepthOfFieldEffect** simulates a camera lens by blurring parts of a scene not in focus. Distant objects can be blurred or this effect can be used to focus on specific parts of a scene, like an item in an in-game shop.

Like other post-processing effects, **DepthOfFieldEffect** will only work while [Enabled](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/PostEffect/Enabled) and when parented to [Lighting](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Lighting) or [Workspace.CurrentCamera](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/Workspace/CurrentCamera). Also, it may render differently on low-end devices or depending on your Studio settings (see the **Quality Level** settings in **Rendering** → **Performance**).

For more details on this effect and others, see the [Post-Processing Effects](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/post-processing-effects) article.
