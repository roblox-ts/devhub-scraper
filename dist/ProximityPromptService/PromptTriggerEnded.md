This event triggers when the player stops holding down the
[`key`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ProximityPrompt#KeyboardKeyCode)/button while triggering a
prompt. This is intended to allow interactions which require the player to
hold a button while something happens in-game.
