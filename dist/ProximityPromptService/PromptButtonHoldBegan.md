This event triggers when the player begins holding down the
[`key`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ProximityPrompt#KeyboardKeyCode)/button on a prompt with a
non-zero [`ProximityPrompt.HoldDuration`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ProximityPrompt#HoldDuration). This can be used to animate
a progress bar.
