This event fires whenever the [NumberValue.Value](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/NumberValue/Value) property is changed.

This event, like other changed events, can be used to track when an NumberValue changes and to track the different values that it may change to.

For instance, this even may be useful in games that rely on NumberValues to track game states and values, such as item IDs.
