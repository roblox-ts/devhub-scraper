This event fires whenever the [`NumberValue.Value`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/NumberValue#Value) property is
changed.

This event, like other changed events, can be used to track when an
NumberValue changes and to track the different values that it may change
to.

For instance, this even may be useful in games that rely on NumberValues
to track game states and values, such as item IDs.

Equivalent changed events exist for similar objects, such as
[`ObjectValue`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ObjectValue) and [`StringValue`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/StringValue), depending on what object type
best suits the need.
